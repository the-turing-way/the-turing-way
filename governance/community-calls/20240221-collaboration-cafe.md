* Thinking about proposing a markdown flavour for protocols - inspired by the format of protocols.io - maybe some kind of extension to MyST (Richard J. Acton)
*  I am moderating this upcoming panel on "Queer Representations of AI", which I'm excited about: [https://www.sas.ac.uk/events/queer-representations-ai](https://www.sas.ac.uk/events/queer-representations-ai) (Kalle)

## Breakout rooms: Topic proposals and notes✨

For more information about breakout rooms see [the description on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md#breakout-rooms).

* Main Room:
   *  1st pomodoro: Abasi-Amefon Affia joins to share an idea for a study about hackathons
      * What does this study look like?
      * Primarily interviews and different methods of learning more about the event, possibly taking pictures.
      * How do the dynamics change during the Book Dash?
      * Concerned more about the trust of the participants. What does your participation in the book dash look like? A lot of people have imposter syndrome, but people don't feel confident about their expertise. Want to make sure that the Book Dash is a safe space.
      * Would love to do that at this month.
      * Participating in all the pre-events could allow you to bring in.your pre-resarch, bringing in the breaks and sharing out on how it's going.
      * What  are "social" or "in-between time"?
      * We're remote first. The majority of the "coffee" or "in-between" times could be in physical room, but online we have specific "social sessions" throughout the day (including a show \& tell)
      * Explicit social sessions are key. And we also have an established slack channel. Slack is wher epeople can maintain these connections that allows people to keep in touch.
      * Asynchronous times part is really interesting, no perfect solution but we have tried a few ways and have a few different solutions that are close to optimised.
      * We have a lot of documentation too! [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html)

   * 2nd pomodoro session: Book Dash planning chats
      * Skils teams members joining the Book Dash Committee
      * Book Dash Committee - have to start promoting the committee + hub applications
      * Do we want to send out invitations to join the committee?
   * 3rd pomodoro: Read the docs transition
      * It's done! Not sure how it works wiht translation
      * Some special things needed for sphinx configuration
      * Can we do deploy previews like Netlify? Yes. Can integrate.
      * Why RTD? Our philosophy has diverged. Enshittification of the platform
   * 4th pomodoro: Open room
* Breakout Room: Inclusive Events chapter/Accessibility Working Group
   * having a brief chat about the different ideas for how to separate out broader accessibility issues, PPIE specific bits and matbe a "missing" chapter with more details on "how to organise events" that moves beyond bullet points?
