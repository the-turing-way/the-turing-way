* Thinking about proposing a markdown flavour for protocols - inspired by the format of protocols.io - maybe some kind of extension to MyST (Richard J. Acton)
*  I am moderating this upcoming panel on "Queer Representations of AI", which I'm excited about: [https://www.sas.ac.uk/events/queer-representations-ai](https://www.sas.ac.uk/events/queer-representations-ai) (Kalle)

* Main Room:
      *  1st pomodoro: Abasi-Amefon Affia joins to share an idea for a study about hackathons, using 
         * What does this study look like?
         * Primarily interviews and different methods of learning more about the event, possibly taking pictures.
         * How do the dynamics change during the Book Dash?
         * Concerned more about the trust of the participants. What does your participation in the book dash look like? A lot of people have imposter syndrome, but people don't feel confident about their expertise. Want to make sure that the Book Dash is a safe space.
         * Would love to do that at this month.
         * Participating in all the pre-events could allow you to bring in.your pre-resarch, bringing in the breaks and sharing out on how it's going.
         * What  are "social" or "in-between time"?
         * We're remote first. The majority of the "coffee" or "in-between" times could be in physical room, but online we have specific "social sessions" throughout the day (including a show \& tell)
         * Explicit social sessions are key. And we also have an established slack channel. Slack is wher epeople can maintain these connections that allows people to keep in touch.
         * Asynchronous times part is really interesting, no perfect solution but we have tried a few ways and have a few different solutions that are close to optimised.
         * We have a lot of documentation too! [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html)

         * Some special things needed for sphinx configuration
         * Can we do deploy previews like Netlify? Yes. Can integrate.
         * Why RTD? Our philosophy has diverged. Enshittification of the platform
      * 4th pomodoro: Open room
* Breakout Room: Inclusive Events chapter/Accessibility Working Group
