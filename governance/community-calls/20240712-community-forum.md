## 📣 Emergent Strategy Principles: Breakout Discussions

*Please take any notes, leave comments and ask question below *

Group 1 

* 4. Never a failure, always a lesson. The industry labels failures.

Group 2 - Esther, Jim, Arielle, Sophia

* Value 3 resonates There is always enough time for the right work. There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.
* Don't make enough time for things that we value 
* Effort in mentoring can have a big pay off long term for the project - cultivating members is important as 
*  
Group 3

* Point 1 resonates, local effects can be strong
* philosophy that "human is good in nature" vs "not good in nature" - echo chambers where people who come to the turing agree with it, but 
* final point resonated too

## 🌼 Code of Conduct Discussion Notes

*Please take any notes, leave comments and ask question below *

**What does the code of conduct mean to you in this community space?**

* Keeping the space safe for anyone to participate - proactive interventions when someone is dominating a discussion
* An indication that the community takes conduct seriously
* Having an inclusive space with ways to hold people accountable/responsible for ensuring it is a safe/inclusive space
* It means knowing that there is a place to come back to, to hold people accountable
* Knowing that there is a process to resolve problems or get feedback if someone is uncomfortable
* It's a safety and means that there feels like there are guardrails so that people aren't mistreated or subject to harm from other community members. 
* It also means that expectations are clear about how to engage in the community (a step before contributing) and more about a common understanding of how to behave, interact, and take part in the community. 
* How the community offers a safe place with clear expectations and acceptable behaviours.
* Setting culture and expectations for behaviour in a proactive and positive way +1
* Being clear that even if ttw is a space where people try to be really nice to each other, there is awareness that "unwanted" behavior can still happen and that we care about it
* Ensuring that we hold space and maintain space for human dignity

**The Turing Way will be setting up an expanded Code of Conduct Committee - what would you like to see incorporated as part of this process?** 

* Maybe just a note: If Anne is currently the report address but not a member of the committee, does that make sense?
* It’d be nice to include a summary of the substantial changes in the Code of Conduct (if any), apart from mentioning the expanded committee +1
* Is there a "vision" for the CoC? Do we want others to use or adapt it?

## Open Discussion \& Topics for next Community Forum

* Community-led discussion around location for access-related practices
* Have the discussion about whether accessibility should be its own guide or embedded in existing guides in the Community Forum? 
* Follow up discussion on CoC committee recruitment proposal (when written)
*  Coc follow up - how can people engage with CoC policy? what does it feel like to raise a code of conduct report? when do you make a report? if a situation arises what would help in raising an issue? maybe add a section on "when should i open a report?"
* a "how to guide" on how to use the code of conduct and what that looks like

## Feedback

Pluses: What did you like from this call? Anything that stuck out for you?

* Culture of transparency, openness and inclusivity, awesome!

Deltas: What can we improve for the next community call?

* zoom links
* read bullet points in the beginning of framapad - note for next host.
