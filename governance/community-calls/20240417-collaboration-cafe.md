* Main Room: Chatty co-working
    * NHS Digital
    * RAP: often led by ONS
    * 3 years ago RAP was very new - they were mostly developing their own practices - they were not thinking about community building
        * Main goal was to automate pipeline
        * Community was a way to adopt those workflow/pipeline
    * Now community has become more important
        * New policies have meant that focus has changed
    * 3 years ago Turing Way were also small
        * we did not know how to work together
    * We have learned new things have moved from being consumers to co-producers
        * We have had more development internally on what we can do to adopt best practices
    * Upstream contribution model: contributing to what we depend on.
    * Lots of overlap between RAP and Turing Way resources
    * Reduce overloading specific maintainers
    * Pre-emptive sharing of guidance in The Turing Way
    * RAP champions case studies
        * [https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions/)

            * They have retired their handbook: [https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/README](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/README)
        * Forced openness can't be good: see - open safely policy: [https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#software-and-reproducibility](https://www.opensafely.org/policies-for-researchers/#software-and-reproducibility)
        * Would be great to have you involved in these conversation:
