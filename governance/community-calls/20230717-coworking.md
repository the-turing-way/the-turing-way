* Notes from meeting with @EstherPlomp @KirstieJane @eirini-zormpa @AlexandraAAJ @malvikasharan

Q from Kirstie: Is the committee working as well as it should be?
- Reflection from Esther as a long-term community member:
  -  It is called a planning committee so it can be unclear what the organisation's role is during the event â€” we can make responsibilities clearer.
  - Chapter has a lot of information in the chapter, but people don't likely read it -- what might be the case? Are there many people assuming the information?
    - Malvika sends detailed information, and hence doesn't feel the need to read them. What is the balance between providing sufficient information but then not overwhelming them?

Q Discussion on the chapter:
- The chapter is written by Malvika and maybe the committee doesn't feel the accountability. 
- Set expectations for the committee members to read the chapter.

Q Discussion on the planning committee's responsibility:
- How do we pivot
  -  Some people have taken more responsibility than others, they should be given strategic leadership roles in a 'Book Dash Strategic Committee' that sets a working group
    - The working group is constituted by recruiting community members who take on different roles
    - Some members of the working group become the Book Dash
- What do we don't want to change?
  - Not the restructuring of what we do - new templating and brand new format will bring chaos and stress to the delivery team
- What should they change? 
  - Evolve with the need of community - e.g. Hub and spoke model that we are working with, anything that they find challenging in the process, updating the community handbook, acting on the feedback from the previous rounds of Book Dash
- Weights of responsibilities are different, how do we address that?
  - Create specific roles and create subteams: Go through the issue checklist and tease out the delivery.
      - Delivery team: should always have project manager, community manager
        - Onboarding the attendees
        - GitHub Training
        - Reviews applications
      - You can be on the working group and delivery team - but full overlap is not needed
      - Working group membership should align with other working group expectations/standards (will replace the Book Dash planning committee)
        - Onboarding to the working group and delivering
        - Chapter updates: Working group (strategic level)
        - Facilitating the debrief/feedback from the Book Dash
        - Review the rubric for application
        - Opens up the applications for Hub, Committee, attendees

Kirstie's notes, possibly overlapping!

* Split the Book Dash Planning Committee into:
  * Book Dash Working Group which is responsible for the strategic vision of the Book Dash
  * Book Dash Delivery Team which is responsible for delivering a specific Book Dash event  (2x per year)
    * Turing Way Research Project Manager always a member
    * Turing Way Research Community Manager always a member
* Book Dash WG is accountable for the Book Dash DT
  * Different responsibilities though!
    * For example the Book Dash WG are responsible for making sure that the DT have everything they need
    * Book Dash WG members don't have to attend DT meetings, nor the specific book dash itself.
    * People are welcome to be members of both WG and DT
  * Members of the DT can stay in post for a shorter amount of time than members of the WG, DT should be a pathway to learning more about the Turing Way and having greater strategic understanding and leadership opportunities.
