## Notes

* RAMs and Turing Way
   * London Tech Week
   * MozFest - **“The Dataset Convening: More than Open - Creating Ethical AI Datasets'' workshop**
   * ‘Beyond Open Research: Understanding What Matters for Quality and Reliability’ is a project funded by Research England: Workshop 3: Developing A Responsible Approach to Data in Society
* Alignment with RAM paper
* Interviews with Hari and Alden on "what is a RAM"
*  What is the conversation the RAM team wants to have with these communities now?
* Why do you need RAMs? Why does it need to be a profession (not just a short term task)? (e.g. system currently disincentivises impact)
* Connecting to TTW via RIR conversation
* Why open? Interoperability to enable ecosystem level impact (delivered through a project)
* Case studies, updating
* KW:  Looking into the root of the tree  - (where does the money flow, where does the prestige flow)
   * Agility
   * Professionalising the RIRs 
   * Why do academics not deliver on applications 
* Why does it mean to think of people as infrastructure 
* forward-looking narrow beam: we will productise your research 
* This feeds into TTW: open, interoperability, inclusion 
* Opportunity for a coherence in the story-telling
* target audience - the depth of the connection with TTW: are working in an interconnected ecosystem in solidarity to address some of these wicked problems 
* London Tech Week: Turing is doing cool stuff (delpoyments/GC related)
* Bridging open source and open research 
   * ‘Beyond Open Research: Understanding What Matters for Quality and Reliability’ is a project funded by Research England: Workshop 3: Developing A Responsible Approach to Data in Society. - reference TTW (e.g. testing, reproducibility, governance documents, running inclusive workshops) 
* There's a real risk of every team "licking all the cookies" and saying that their expertise is very broad ranging..... so the hard part is both being clear on the depth and the shared motivations / history AND knowing the specialities!
