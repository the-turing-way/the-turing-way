## Clarifying Governance Progress (5 min)

[ Alexandra ]
*The Turing Way* Core staff delivery group (Ale, Anne, Arielle, Kirstie and Malvika) are working on the launch of an official Governance document.

Based on the pad you answered [at the community call after the Book Dash](https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-may2023-communitycall) and [mapped conversations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T7rx6Kvsj7OsXkFMjOGRgNlqobGTpMaJD8fL-OFMBVc/edit#gid=0) at Coworking meetings and Collaboration Cafe, we have identified 3 main challenges about our current Governance:

| Challenge 1 | Challenge 2 | Challenge  3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Frameworks** | **Strategy** | **Culture**
| - Guidelines for WG to make decisions (Decision trees) |- Long-term Structures | - Differences & clarity about paid and volunteers team members
| - Guidelines to onboard members and structure for growth (Mountain of Engagement)     | - Short-term Structure | - TTW Funding approaches (paying non-Turing members)
| - Guidelines for engagement (Personas & Pathways)  | - Separating strategic & operational responsibilities  | - Who has the power to make decisions?

Therefore, we would like to use this meeting to:

- Share the Governance documentation documents
- Collect your impressions about *The Turing Way* Decision Making
    - Individual reflections about your experience & perceptions
    - Small Group discussions about various aspects of governance: reviewing key needs & getting feedback on sample structures 
- Ask for references about good Governance documents you have produced or came across that could be useful in preparation for The Turing Way Governance doc. 

* REMINDER: Reviewing survey (please fill out if you haven't already!): https://forms.gle/dEyWZpcMUEVbpGYm7

**Next actions:**   
* Identify the sections/headings our Governance documents will
* Develop a timeline and consult each section with community members
* **Urgent need**: Produce a governance official document  


## Guided discussion for core team (30 min)

[ Kirstie ]

Building on the 1-2-4-all Librating Format (https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/), we will be using this time to learn more about what teams need.

    * Clarify objectives: https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash.html

    * Pathway
* funding allocation 
    * TTW team will take this on
* what an external collaboration with ttw could look like 
* relationship between the Turing Institute and The Turing Way +1 million +1+1+1+1

* all of them?
* who do we consult for big changes e.g. Jupyter Enhancement Proposals? [democratic mediums](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/)
    * It should definitely be a simpler process than JEPs :sweat_smile:  Django

* 
* 

### Big discussion about comments (10 min)

**What decisions does the governance document need to clarify?**

* transparency vs not being able to find things 
* acessibility vs transparency are different things
* don't want lists of lists to find things
* user experience of community contribution
* power of relationships & connections as a means of acquiring information
* difficult to manage hardcore transparency with importance of building relationships
* slack is a lot - important messages can be lost quickly (many people are in multiple workspaces)
* turing people in general say please cut down on emails
* most visible issue mentioned above is the relationship between the turing institute and the turing way (especially regarding funding allocation)
    * how can we make this relationship more clear?
* is Kirstie the BDFL? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)
    * emergently, KW is, but written into founding documents of TTW that this should not be the case
    * upcoming governance documentation should include information about this
    * design of the turing way should be that it should be able to exist within the turing institute 
    * important to tease apart the relationship with tps & staff members
    * when should a coup happen???? (lol - jk for the reader)
    * role of power dynamics & hierarchies, and teasing out these relationships
    * up to what point does the turing way have a specific vision (that comes from the turing) and the community-led vision (coming from)
* what's the difference between being 'community-led' and being 'community-inspired' or 'community-informed'
* turing way core delivery staff will draft a version of the document to share more widely with the core team
    * role of core team is to hold the core delivery staff accountable to reporting out and listening to feedback
    *

## Closing & Next steps (5 min)

[ Anne ]

*Feedback on this call & format*
* I very much appreciated the time for discussion (instead of everyone sharing a lot of information that could have also been shared via newsletter/issue or email)
* The hour went quickly, time flies...
