### Kirstie Whitaker

* Role: **Project lead**
* GitHub id: [kirstiejane](http://github.com/kirstiejane)
* ORCID: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-4059)
* Short bio:
> I'm the lead of Tools, Practices and Systems research Programme at the Alan Turing Institute.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

* Personal highlights:
> I am the lead of _The Turing Way_.
> I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
> I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

* More information:
> I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
> I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
> But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
> Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance process that is inclusive and community-lead.

### Alexander Morley

* Role: Infrastructure Maintainer (2018 - 2019)
* GitHub id: [alexmorley](http://github.com/alexmorley)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)

* Short bio:
> I am a Mozilla Fellow (2018-) and a PhD Candidate at the MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit at the University of Oxford (2015-).
> I also receive support from the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship programme (2018) and Microsoft/Research Software England Cloud Computing Fellowship programme (2018).
> My undergraduate degree was in Medicine at the University of Oxford (2012-2015).

* Personal Highlight:
> As a core contributros I want to share "Why I care about the Turing Way?: When people don't use best practices in data science its almost always because they either don't know about them, or feel they don't have time. Advocates will tell people that the time is saved in the long-term, but it's a hard sell.
> By providing concrete, incremental, but authoritative, guidance I believe the Turing Way could provide the nudge that allows people to realise the benefits for themselves, and lowers the barrier for more researchers to acquire these highly valued skills.

* More information:
> I really want research to be accessible, but in a much broader sense than the word is often used. I would love to see a world where re-mixing research is a common thing, whether that be re-mixing figures to make them easier to understand, re-using data to generate new insights, or testing new methods to see how our theories might need to change.
> Slightly less on topic, but just as important, I am also passionate about the development and adoption of best-practices in governance. Safe and inclusive spaces are all too rare in academia, and I think some part of that can be solved by doing away with our laissez-faire attitude towards governance and management.

### Emma Karoune

* Role:
    * Core Contributor
    * Book Dash November 2020 Attendee
    * Book Dash Planning Committee 2021
* GitHub id: [EKaroune](https://github.com/EKaroune)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-6576-6053](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6576-6053)
* Short bio:
I'm a Research Associate and Community Manager of DECOVID at The Alan Turing Institute. I’m also a post-doctoral researcher working in the field of Environmental Archaeology and Palaeoecology. I have a PhD in Palaeoecology from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. I am leading a project to improve the FAIRness of phytolith data. I am also working on a project with Historic England concerning the development of novel methodologies in phytolith research for application to British Archaeological remains.

* Personal highlights:
>I have really enjoyed working in such a collaborative way during the Book Dash. I have had interesting discussions concerning the accessibility of The Turing way, collaboration, communication and research in general with other contributors.
>I have further developed my Github skills by working in collaboration with @paulowoicho, @malvikasharan and @KirstieJane to develop a chapter on 'Getting started on Github'.
>This improvement in my skills will really benefit my own personal research to develop my own collaborative working groups and teach others how to use these research tools.
> In 2021 Book Dash, I've enjoyed mentoring new contributors contributions, reviewing pull requests and helping to run sessions during the Book Dash. It was great to work collaboratively to improve and publish a new chapter on 'Communicating with wider audiences' in the Guide for Communication.

* More information:
>I try to work as openly as possible and a large part of my current research is developing easy and accessible to all collaborative and open ways of working. I am also working hard to bring together specialists in my field into a working group for Open Science so that we can work collaboratively towards subject-specific FAIR guidelines for phytolith data.

* Quotes:
> Such a great week! Supportive collaborative environment to produce some really quality contributions to this wonderful project.

### Eric Daub

* GitHub id: [edaub](https://github.com/edaub)
* Short bio:
>Eric is a data scientist and geophysics researcher, has appeared on several television programs and podcasts to discuss his research on earthquake occurrence in the Central United States. One challenge for presenting earthquake research is the tendency to overhype results on the topic of earthquake prediction. Eric used these media appearances to highlight the difficulties inherent in predicting earthquakes, and explain why no reliable method exists to predict earthquakes accurately enough for societal actions to take place. From that discussion about overhyped results, he transitioned to explaining how his research showed that the chances of an earthquake had not changed due to recent changes in activity, as the fluctuations were *exactly* in line with what would be expected for a simple baseline level of risk. This outreach activity helped improve the understanding of the target audience on a complex, technical subject and debunk some of the commonly held assumptions about earthquake prediction and risk management.

### Hannah Nicholls

* Role: Book Dash 2021 participant
* GitHub id: hlnicholls
* ORCID:https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3480-7852

* Short bio:
> I am a PhD student contributing to The Turing Way to develop writing about reproducible research practices. I have a BSc in biomedical science and a background in wet-lab cardiovascular research. My PhD is in applying machine learning to prioritise most likely causal disease genes from genome-wide association studies.

* Personal highlights:
> Collaborating with others to build something new as a contribution to The Turing Way, and collaborating with others to review and support their work. Understanding the inner workings of The Turing Way via navigating within its GitHub. Also getting to help and watch a really cool illustration being made!

* Quotes:
> Taking part in the Turing Way Book Dash was one of the first times I've done collaborative working over an extended period of time and it was such a great experience! It allowed me to try out new skills and really build confidence in what I was doing, I feel really encouraged to continue contributing to The Turing Way!


### Heidi Seibold

* Role: Core contributor (2020), Book Dash February 2020 Attendee
* GitHub id: [HeidiSeibold](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold)
* ORCID id: [0000-0002-8960-9642](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-9642)
* Short bio:
> I lead a group on Open AI in Health at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich. I develop machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
> My passion for open and reproducible research has led me to join the Turing Way community. I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research), I support, teach and contribute to open projects such as The Turing Way.
> My work for the *Journal of Statistical Software* includes reproducibility checks. We only publish papers which are fully computationally reproducible. I also work on making our machine-learning software more user-friendly, reusable and extensible. Together with a PhD student I am thinking about how to
use data from hospitals to help doctors and patients find the right treatment
for each individual patient.

* Personal highlights:
> I work in data science and open and reproducible research are the things I think and
care about the most. So to me it only made sense to get involved. Plus: the community seemed
amazing!
> To me The Turing Way is a role model when it comes to collaborative,
distributed work. I learned so much just by participating in the book sprint
and seeing how Malvika, Kirstie and everyone else contributed to providing an
extremely welcoming and at the same time productive space. I took what
I learned and tried to apply it in other contexts such as teaching. I will
continue to do so.
> The Turing Way also inspired me to think about new ways we could teach people
about open and reproducible (data) science. I am currently thinking a lot about
how we could use the content from The Turing Way and turn it into a course.
This idea was also part of an application, where I proposed to start a new
group on *Open AI*.
> Specifically, I have co-authored these chapters: [Research Compendia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html), [File Naming Convention](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/filenaming.html), and reviewed many contributions.
> I regularly recommend The Turing Way as a resource. Both for learning more
about reproducible data science and also when discussing specific topics.
I think that people are taking it on and reading it :)

* More information:
> First, I would like to continue to help create content, review others content
and be helpful in any way I can. Sometimes I like to look at really old issues
and pull requests for example. Reviving such old, often almost finished bits,
is very rewarding.
> Apart from that I also have a bigger, long term idea for The Turing Way.
I personally am not a huge fan of reading. So books are not my favorite way to
learn.  In the past years I learned a lot by listening to others in talks,
podcasts, videos, and of course conversations.  So for me it is only a natural
next step for The Turing Way to become more than a book. It could be an
ecosystem, with the book at its basis. And -- if we decide to go that route --
I would like to be a part of it.

### Irene K

* Role: Book Dash November 2020 Attendee
* GitHub id: [irenekp](http://github.com/irenekp)
* Short bio:
> I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Information Science and Engineering. While short, my journey with Data Science and Data Management has been varied and I've loved watching how a single concept can mould into so many different disciplines! I have been able to work with data science as an RA for a couple of projects that focused on different aspects of Social Network Analysis. I've also been able to follow data management and related practices during my internships at a fintech and a telecom company.

* Personal highlights:
> Turing Way was my first foray into Open Source, and I have found it extremely helpful in learning both about general github and open source practices as well as being part of a moving and collaborative community. I especially loved being part of an extremely multidisciplinary group of people, really shows me the real span of Data Science!
> The ethics book has been a great source of interest for me as it encompasses many of the issues I both grappled with, debated and deliberated upon extensively during my own data science projects.
> During my time working on the Data Anonymization Chapter (Issue: #1578 , Pull Request: #1579 ) I managed to read more extensively about anonymization and I found answers to many of the questions that had previously bothered me.
> I really hope that the work we've done here to consolidate all these ethical guidelines will help make practicing data science with a strong ethical basis and clear moral conscience more easy and accessible.

* More information:
> In line with my contributions so far, I am extremely passionate about working on an ethical framework for Data Science, seeing as a lot of it focuses on exposing patterns that could easily be invasive, I really think an ethical approach to it is the only way to keep practicing it sustainably in the long term.
> Science Communication is an other one of my key areas of interest, I've been combining it with my love for sustainable practices (be it data science or water resource management) so far to research upon and write articles that I hope would inform and educate more people! I hope to add Data Visualization to this combination soon!
> I intend to keep working at the cross roads of Data Science and Sci-Comm for the foreseeable future!

* ORCID: [0000-0002-4910-9205](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-9205)
* Short bio:
> I’m a Research Data Scientist in the Alan Turing Institute’s Research Engineering Group.
> I have a degree in Physics from Imperial College London, after which I joined the Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre at the University of Oxford.
> I worked on an interdisciplinary PhD project that combined mathematical modelling, cardiac electrophysiology and safety pharmacology, and moved over to the Turing afterwards.
> Since then, I’ve worked on a range of projects spanning synthetic data, data visualisation, and of course, the Turing Way!

* Personal highlights:
> I got involved with _The Turing Way_ via case studies of reproducibility in academic projects - essentially, I was a reproducibility detective during the initial phase of the project! :female_detective: The Turing Way was my first experience of working with collaborators from so many different institutions, and the community around this project has been a real highlight for me. My official time on the Turing Way has come to an end, but I still enjoy keeping in touch through the Book Dashes and other events.

* More information:
> As scientists, we share our work via papers and talks, but the intricacies of precisely *how* we implement an analysis pipeline or novel algorithm can be very difficult to convey in those formats.
> We're currently seeing changes in the default way we want to publish our papers through the open access movement, and I'd love to see a similar change in mindset happen about the data that we collect and the code that we develop so that others can reproduce, learn from and build upon our work.
> I want to ensure that the route to sharing these types of research output is open to everyone, regardless of their level of programming experience - the route might not always be straightforward, but it's a great opportunity to share and learn from our experiences!
> So many research projects now contain computational elements, yet it is easy to forget that not everyone has access to training in software engineering, or has a group of colleagues with such interests.
> If we say that we want people to make their research open and reproducible, we need to give them the tools they need to be confident in doing so.
> I see the Turing Way as the means of bridging that gap, by providing a friendly, practical and helpful guide for researchers at all stages of their careers.

### Martin O'Reilly

* Role: Core Contributor (2019)
* GitHub id: [martintoreilly](http://github.com/martintoreilly)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)
* Short bio:
> I'm Principal Research Software Engineer and Deputy Head of the Research Engineering Group at the Alan Turing Institute.
> My focus is on using good software engineering practices to increase the impact of research software by making it reusable, reliable and robust
> I also have a strong interest in reproducible research, and am working to improve the tools and working practices at the Turing to make it easier for our researchers to work reproducibly
> I've moved back and forth between industry and academia over the years, gaining an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience along the way.

* More information:
> I feel strongly that researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the outcomes of their research are made available to all - researchers, practitioners and the public.
> These outcomes should be made available in a way that allows others not just to reproduce them, but also to re-use and build upon them.
> An awful lot of researcher and practitioner time is spent getting to the point they can usefully evaluate whether some research is of use to them, or in re-discovering unpublished negative results.
> This seems extremely wasteful and I'm convinced we can and should do better.
> In particular, I feel a lot can be done to improve the effective re-use of data produced by research projects.
> While there has been significant progress in recent years in the amount of data published alongside research articles, there is still a wide gulf between open data and re-usable data.
> In terms of research areas, I'm fascinated by the brain and especially the approach of understanding the brain by "faking it" (i.e. modelling and simulation).
> I'm particularly interested in robots as a way of embodying these models in the real world.
> I believe the Turing Way can impact positively in both these areas.
> By providing recommended working practices and guidance on associated tooling, we can make it easy for researchers to do the right thing.
> By publishing this with the weight of the Turing brand, we can apply social pressure for the adoption of these practices as new norms in the research communities we operate in.

> Not only have I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for how GitHub works, but I am also learning to prioritise sustainability and empowerment in the work that I do.
> Although The Turing Way is my first open source project, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learned a lot along the way. Before the GSoD program, I only used Github to 'store' my projects. Now, I am much more proficient at using Github for collaborative endeavours and I am more adept at working with tools such as Markdown, Jupyter Book, and Sphinx. In addition, I gained familiarity with setting up and working with web analytics software.
> You can see the full report from GSoD participation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/communications/GSOD-applications/GSoD-2020-Project-Report.md).
> The BookDash November 2020 was great! It was awesome to meet, collaborate, and share ideas with people from around the world. Beyond the Book Dash, The Turing Way is the very first open-source project I have ever worked on. The experience has been fantastic, and I intend to stick around as a contributor after the Google Season of Docs program ends. I also see myself getting involved in other open-source projects.

* Personal Quote:
> Asides technical skills, I developed a deep appreciation for what working on an open source project entails. My mentors helped me realise that the value I left behind from the GSoD program was not in the amount of work I did, but how I enabled other contributors to also do the work I was doing. As a result, I learned to contribute as a Technical Writer in a manner that was reproducible, sustainable, accessible, and inclusive.
