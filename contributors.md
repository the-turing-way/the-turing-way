* GitHub id: [kirstiejane](http://github.com/kirstiejane)
* ORCID: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-4059)
* Short bio:
> I'm the lead of Tools, Practices and Systems research Programme at the Alan Turing Institute.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

* Personal highlights:
> I am the lead of _The Turing Way_.
> I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
> I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

* More information:
> I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
> I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
> But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
> Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance processs that is inclusive and community-lead.

### Alexander Morley

* GitHub id: [alexmorley](http://github.com/alexmorley)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)
* Short bio:
> I am a Mozilla Fellow (2018-) and a PhD Candidate at the MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit at the University of Oxford (2015-).
> I also receive support from the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship programme (2018) and Microsoft/Research Software England Cloud Computing Fellowship programme (2018).
> My undergraduate degree was in Medicine at the University of Oxford (2012-2015).

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I really want research to be accessible, but in a much broader sense than the word is often used. I would love to see a world where re-mixing research is a common thing, whether that be re-mixing figures to make them easier to understand, re-using data to generate new insights, or testing new methods to see how our theories might need to change.
> Slightly less on topic, but just as important, I am also passionate about the development and adoption of best-practices in governance. Safe and inclusive spaces are all too rare in acedemia, and I think some part of that can be solved by doing away with our laissez-faire attitude towards governance and management.

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

> When people don't use best practices in data science its almost always because they either don't know about them, or feel they don't have time. Advocates will tell people that the time is saved in the long-term, but it's a hard sell.
> By providing concrete, incremental, but authoratitve, guidance I believe the Turing Way could provide the nudge that allows people to realise the benefits for themselves, and lowers the barrier for more researchers to acquire these highly valued skills.

* ORCID: [0000-0002-2378-4915](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2378-4915)
* Short bio:
> I’m a Research Software Engineer at the University of Sheffield helping researchers do more with their code and data.
> I’m also an editor for rOpenSci, a community of users and developers, Creating technical infrastructure of peer-reviewed R software tools for working with scientific data sources on the web.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I care about reproducible research in R!
> I learnt to code during my PhD in Marine Macroecology and was instantly hooked.
> Building on past experience as a quality assurance auditor, my experiences made me interested in how we practice science and specifically how we can do more out of the real workhorses of modern research, our code and data.
> Working in _The Turing Way_ is a fantastic opportunity to take stock of the great work that has already been done in this space, aggregate and distill it to templates, checklists and  best practices guidelines that are immediately useful to researchers.  
> It’s an opportunity to set standards and harness the power of convention, especially with ECRs that have an opportunity to set up good practices from the start! Indeed, I hope the Turing Way will very much become the “Sheffield Way” too!

### Becky Arnold

* GitHub id: [r-j-arnold](http://github.com/r-j-arnold)
* ORCID: [0000-0003-0355-0617](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0355-0617)
* Short bio:
> I'm an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Sheffield and I do computer simulations of star forming regions.
> I'm a 2018 Software Sustainability Institute fellow using the funds to organise talks and workshops about various issues surrounding good programming practise.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I am passionate about Science.
> All over the world humans come together to try and figure out how the universe works and that's *amazing*, just as amazing as the answers themselves.
> I'm also passionate about how we actually do that science, making sure it's accurate and reproducible.
> If it isn't both of those things we haven't moved forwards much, or worse still end up going in circles.
> I care deeply about changing the culture of academia, in which abuse of power (both minor and major) is all too common.
> I've met so many people that want to code well and follow best practise, which will benefit science enormously, but struggle to know how to do so.
> While there are lots of fantastic resources out there they're often scattered and _The Turing Way_ can improve that.
I also hope that it can convince people that don't consider themselves capable of being good programmers that there are steps they can take to drastically improve their coding.

### Louise Bowler

* GitHub id: [LouiseABowler](http://github.com/LouiseABowler)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-4910-9205](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-9205)
* Short bio:
> I’m a Research Data Scientist in the Alan Turing Institute’s Research Engineering Group.
> I have a degree in Physics from Imperial College London, after which I joined the Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre at the University of Oxford.
> I worked on an interdisciplinary PhD project that combined mathematical modelling, cardiac electrophysiology and safety pharmacology, and moved over to the Turing afterwards.
> Since then, I’ve worked on a range of projects spanning synthetic data, data visualisation, and of course, the Turing Way!

* Personal highlights:
> I got involved with _The Turing Way_ via case studies of reproducibility in academic projects - essentially, I was a reproducibility detective during the initial phase of the project! :female_detective: The Turing Way was my first experience of working with collaborators from so many different institutions, and the community around this project has been a real highlight for me. My official time on the Turing Way has come to an end, but I still enjoy keeping in touch through the Book Dashes and other events.

* More information:
> As scientists, we share our work via papers and talks, but the intricacies of precisely *how* we implement an analysis pipeline or novel algorithm can be very difficult to convey in those formats.
> We're currently seeing changes in the default way we want to publish our papers through the open access movement, and I'd love to see a similar change in mindset happen about the data that we collect and the code that we develop so that others can reproduce, learn from and build upon our work.
> I want to ensure that the route to sharing these types of research output is open to everyone, regardless of their level of programming experience - the route might not always be straightforward, but it's a great opportunity to share and learn from our experiences!
> So many research projects now contain computational elements, yet it is easy to forget that not everyone has access to training in software engineering, or has a group of colleagues with such interests.
> If we say that we want people to make their research open and reproducible, we need to give them the tools they need to be confident in doing so.
> I see the Turing Way as the means of bridging that gap, by providing a friendly, practical and helpful guide for researchers at all stages of their careers.

### Martin O'Reilly

* GitHub id: [martintoreilly](http://github.com/martintoreilly)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)
* Short bio:
> I'm Principal Research Software Engineer and Deputy Head of the Research Engineering Group at the Alan Turing Institute.
> My focus is on using good software engineering practices to increase the impact of research software by making it reusable, reliable and robust
> I also have a strong interest in reproducible research, and am working to improve the tools and working practices at the Turing to make it easier for our researchers to work reproducibly
> I've moved back and forth between industry and academia over the years, gaining an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience along the way.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I feel strongly that researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the outcomes of their research are made available to all - researchers, practitioners and the public.
> These outcomes should be made available in a way that allows others not just to reproduce them, but also to re-use and build upon them.
> An awful lot of researcher and practitioner time is spent getting to the point they can usefully evaluate whether some research is of use to them, or in re-discovering unpublished negative results.
> This seems extremely wasteful and I'm convinced we can and should do better.
> In particular, I feel a lot can be done to improve the effective re-use of data produced by research projects.
> While there has been significant progress in recent years in the amount of data published alongside research articles, there is still a wide gulf between open data and re-usable data.
> In terms of research areas, I'm fascinated by the brain and especially the approach of understanding the brain by "faking it" (i.e. modelling and simulation).
> I'm particularly interested in robots as a way of embodying these models in the real world.
> I believe the Turing Way can impact positively in both these areas.
> By providing recommended working practices and guidance on associated tooling, we can make it easy for researchers to do the right thing.
> By publishing this with the weight of the Turing brand, we can apply social pressure for the adoption of these practices as new norms in the research communities we operate in.

* Short bio:
> I am a Research Data Specialist at University of Edinburgh's Digital Curation Centre, UK.
> I am a 2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellow and HiddenREF committee member.
> From 2016 to 2019, I worked as Research Repository Advisor at the University of Birmingham.
> From 2012 to 2016, I've worked at CERN as a doctoral student supporting Open Research stuff and then abandoned the PhD and started a real job using all the skills I aquired.

* Personal highlights:
> Working on the Turing Way reminded me about what I value in my work and that I do have more technical skill than I think.
> Based on the Turing Way work, I have started the product managmement role for DMPonline and I'm trying to take the inspiration from the project into my every day work whenever I can.

* More information:
> As a librarian, it feels like our influence is often limited, but I try to set up workshops/events to at least get the discussion started and give especially PhD students the feeling that they can challenge the status quo and there will be people in the institution that will support them that might not be their supervisor.
> I really love how the Turing Way aims to create good examples and I hope we can develop some ideas and resources that can have a positive impact in changing the current system.
> I care about collaborating and get really excited about trying new tools if my limited tech skills allow.

### Rosie Higman

* ORCID: [0000-0001-5329-7168](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5329-7168)
* Short bio:
> I am a Research Data Librarian at the University of Manchester, co-leading the research data management support service.
> My focus is on data sharing, training and encouraging researchers to engage in Open Research.
> My background is in the social sciences and I have recently started a PhD with the British Library and the University of Sheffield looking at Open Access and the role of the National Library.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I am passionate about Supporting researchers! Making it as easy as possible for researchers to make their research reproducible and open, and for this to be easier than undertaking research in a closed manner.
> I try to help researchers make small improvements in making their research open, on the basis that some progress is better than none!
> Working in research data management I'm naturally concerned that data is not taken seriously as an independent research output and the reward system in academia is so heavily geared towards 'high impact' journal articles.
> As someone from a non-STEM background I'm also interested in how we can make reproducible research as accessible as possible. This will be the first project where I've worked directly in GitHub and I'm excited to get more confident in using it!
> I spend much of my time talking to researchers about the overarching principles of *why* reproducible and open research is a good idea and am excited by the idea of giving people practical guidance on *how* to do this.
> Messy code is frequently cited in these discussions as a reason for not sharing code so if we could produce something which helps people get past this barrier would be great.
> I hope that the Turing Way will be something we can also use at the University of Manchester and other Turing universities around the country!


### Rachael Ainsworth

* GitHub id: [rainsworth](http://github.com/rainsworth)
* ORCID: [0000-0003-2591-9462](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2591-9462)
* Short bio:
> I am the Research Software Community Manager at the Software Sustainability Institute.
> Previously, I worked as a Research Associate and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester.
> My research involved observing jets from young stars with next-generation radio telescopes to investigate the physical processes that assemble stars like our Sun, and am currently working to make data from the radio telescope facilities at Jodrell Bank more accessible to all.
> I am also a FOSTER certified Open Science Trainer, Mozilla Open Leader, and Organiser for the women in data meetup group HER+Data MCR.

* Personal highlights:
> I have promoted *The Turing Way* through many presentations, notably at the Open Science Fair 2019 where I presented a poster and delivered 3 demonstrations of the project to attendees, one of which was recorded as part of the [ORION Open Science Podcast](https://orionopenscience.podbean.com/e/the-fair-is-in-town-figshare-the-turing-way-and-open-science-quest-at-the-osfair2019/).
> Through *The Turing Way* project I have gained valuable skills in open project management and met truly inspiring individuals working hard to promote openness and reproducibility in research.

* More information:
> I am passionate about promoting openness, transparency, reproducibility, wellbeing and inclusion in STEM and facilitating cross-stakeholder conversations in order to change research culture for the better.
> I also love space exploration.
> *The Turing Way* goal of ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do" really resonates with me.
> I find that it can be difficult to get researchers to engage with reproducibility and sharing their research outputs because they perceive that it will take too much time and effort with very little reward - when the opposite is true!
> Ensuring results are reproducible not only benefits research as a whole and increases efficiency, but working this way also offers researchers more opportunities for impact and collaboration.
