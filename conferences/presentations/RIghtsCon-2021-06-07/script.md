# Script for lightning talk at RightsCon2021

8-10 minute recorded talk, in the Human Rights-Centered Design track - probably about 1500 words
(possibly also with an AMA during the conference)

## Original pitch
([original application](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/conferences/abstracts/2021-01-RightsCon.md))
Data scientists make data-driven decisions throughout the lifecycle of their projects. 
It is their duty to ensure that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity as well as the highest scientific standards, especially, when it impacts people’s lives. 
In this presentation, we will introduce The Turing Way, an open source book project that involves and supports its diverse community in developing and sharing resources that make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive. 
In particular, we will demonstrate the Turing Way guide for Ethical Research, the community behind its development, and its human rights-centred approach to data science ethics as a practice that includes activism for change. 
Most importantly, we will tell you how you can get involved!

(Introduce speakers)

_MALVIKA:_
The Turing Way is an open source project that involves and supports its diverse community in making data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive for everyone. We believe that to make our project truly beneficial and comprehensible we need to collaborate with people with diverse skills, backgrounds and domain knowledge.    

As data scientists, we make decisions throughout the lifecycle of our data-based projects. As scientists, we have a duty to ensure that our work meets the highest scientific standards. We also have an obligation to ensure that our work maintains the highest level of moral integrity: especially when it impacts people’s lives. This impact on lives can be through the data we collect and use, or through the data products we build. It can also be through the policies that we follow at our universities or institutions, and the working conditions that we create in our labs.

The Turing Way is led by Kirstie Whitaker and our monnshot goal is to make reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science 'too easy not to do.' The book is based at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence. 

There are five guides in the Turing Way: covering topics in reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration and ethical research - as well as we provide a community handbook. This talk focuses on the Guide to Ethical Research.

_LAURA: _

The aim of the Guide to Ethical Research is to support data scientists - and researchers using data science - to work in an ethical way. We start from the position that as data science researchers, we have an obligation to consider the impact of our research. So far, contributors to the Guide to Ethical Research have contributed chapters on working with institutional ethics boards, the relationship between ethics and research integrity, and ethics in preclinical research.

But we don't see ethics as a static or one-off part of the research process. Ethical research includes recognising where your data comes from, and the impact of collecting and using it in your work. 
The Guide to Ethical Research also includes information on how to be an activist researcher. One of our most recent chapters is on how to advocate for policy change within your institution: if you don't like how something is done, you can change it! 

We include case studies on how to organise against unethical tech, such as the successful campaign against Robodebt in Australia. 
And we recognise that ethical research includes treating your colleagues and collaborators well. The Guide to Ethical Research includes information about workers’ rights for scientific workers: and information about how you can join and support a union yourself!

Ethical data science research also includes making sure that ethical work is grounded within existing human rights frameworks. 
Human rights are defined in law. 
This means in many ways they are less malleable than ethics.
The laws governing human rights, and the ways that they are implemented, are agreed internationally,
A violation of human rights is a violation wherever it happens. 

This is not necessarily true of codes of ethics. 
An action that one group of people sees as ethical, may be seen as unethical by others. 

There is a wider shared understanding of what human rights means across different countries, cultures and groups of people.
It’s important to recognise that the work required to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights looks different for different people, and that means it’s important to listen to everyone about what being able to enjoy their human rights means to them
Making sure that research complies with human rights is not just about ensuring that it doesn't harm. It can also be about doing work that is actively pro-rights.
Researchers and data scientists should, in general ensure that they respect, protect, and fulfil human rights: 
this means not doing work that itself abuses human rights
It also means trying to ensure that their work cannot be used by others to abuse human rights
And it also means doing work that actively helps other people be able to enjoy all their human rights
There are accountability and enforcement mechanisms within the human rights framework.
But because they are a legal framework, they are not as easily accessible, and hard to apply to the daily work of data science and research. Which is why for researchers, ethical guidance and codes can be a useful way to interpret and implement human rights in their work.
The Turing Way Guide to Ethical Research is based on these three principles. Ethical research respects, protects, and fulfils human rights. 

_MALVIKA:_

We foster a culture of collaboration by ensuring that the collaboration is not defined just by the common goals, product or the team. But, we ensure that people are given the inclusive workspace that they need to perform their best. That they treat each other kindly, abide by the code of conduct, know what roles they can take, and contribute to building diverse teams by explicitly opening ideas for contributions. In all our work, we apply open leadership principles.

We define pathways for collaboration that always require multiple people to support each other. For example, people are invited to develop and share resources through mentored contributions, 
We also create opportunities for people to maintain and improve resources which could be as simple as fixing a broken link or a bug, or creating new resources of their interest. Contributors are also those who share these resources, review and update the existing chapters and translate them in languages that ensure accessibility for a  wonder community. Finally, we encourage everyone to share best practices by highlighting their work.

To represent differents perspectives, It’s important to us that the book is a community project: driven by the needs and wishes of the contributors, and built with those needs in mind. We involve diverse voices and acknowledge all contributions fairly. We understand, that if we do not recognise all contributions, we will end up disproportionately ignoring the hidden labour that a lot of people do, and especially those who are new to the tech communities. Often those people are members of marginalised groups who have historically been excluded from Open Source and tech spaces. 

As a community-developed resource, The Turing Way Guide to Ethical Research is a work in progress: and it’s open source, We have contributors from all over the world – you can see the time zones they are in here. 
We host multiple community events and calls weekly and you are invited to join us. You can find details in the shared notes - these slides are available on Zenodo. You can also reach out to Laura or me directly: 

If you go to bit.ly/turingway you can find a link to these slides, as well as the emails addresses to contact Laura or me directly
And you can also join us for the AMA during RightsCon

Thanks to Kirstie Whitaker for starting this project.  All our resources are available online and I am happy to share more details.

We're looking forward to having you join us!
