## Session Concept 

### What’s your product, initiative, or innovation?  (150 words)
_In a few sentences, tell us what you plan to demo. (Yes, we know it’s not much space – make it count!)_

Data scientists make data-driven decisions throughout the lifecycle of their projects. 
It is their duty to ensure that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity as well as the highest scientific standards, especially, when it impacts people’s lives.
In this presentation, we will introduce The Turing Way, an open source book project that involves and supports its diverse community in developing and sharing resources that make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive. 
In particular, we will demonstrate the Turing Way guide for Ethical Research, the community behind its development, and its human rights-centred approach to data science ethics as a practice that includes activism for change. 
Most importantly, we will demonstrate how RightsCon attendees can get involved! 


### What makes you the right person to speak about this product, initiative, or innovation? (150 words)
_Now’s the time to sell yourself as a speaker. Don’t hold back._

Laura is a human rights researcher who is one of the Ethics Guide collaborators: as well as developing content that is practical and accessible for data researchers, she also guides new contributors as a new open science contributor herself!

Malvika is the Community Manager of The Turing Way. She is based at The Alan Turing Institute in the United Kingdom and brings her extensive experience in open science and collaboration to a global community spanning 6 continents. 

### Do you have a link to whatever product, project, or innovation that you want to demo? We want to see it!
