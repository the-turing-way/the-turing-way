## Title: _The Turing Way_: A guide to reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science

The Turing Way is an open-source and community-led book project that involves and supports its contributors to develop chapters on reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science practices.
So far, over 22 chapters on reproducible research have been collaboratively developed by >175 contributors.
The project is developed and maintained openly on GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) and is hosted online as Jupyter Book at https://book.the-turing-way.org/.

With a JupyterCon Sprint, we will engage with the attendees by introducing them to The Turing Way. They will be able to build upon and enhance the existing contents by introducing their perspectives and expertise. 
Only by involving diverse members from different backgrounds and identities, The Turing Way book can become comprehensible and useful for everyone.
Their contributions will include, but are not limited to:
- relevant examples and case studies
- science communication skills
- new chapters inspired by their work 
- Jupyter infrastructure of the project
