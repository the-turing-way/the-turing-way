The Turing Way is a community-driven book project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible and ethical data research is "too easy not to do". 
The book is openly available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence, and presents a sustainable alternative to the more traditional way of sharing best practices via articles.

The Turing Way aims to bridge the gap between innovative data research techniques and best practices that make them accessible and comprehensible for everyone. 
The Turing Way is designed to be inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. 
We welcome ideas, case studies, impact stories, educational resources, or any sort of participation that individuals can benefit from or use to advance their knowledge in data research. 
All contributions, questions, comments, and discussions are made via an online repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. 
This ensures that all the contributions are openly accessible. 
To ensure long term preservation, a snapshot of the repository is also hosted on a data repository (10.5281/zenodo.3233853).

In this lightning talk, a community member will introduce the Turing Way Project and highlight the importance of creating a culture that promotes collaboration and accessibility to ensure the long-term sustainability of our communities.

**What format(s) is/are your presentation best suited to?**
- [x] Lightning talk (maximum five minutes)
- [ ] Posters (infographics or slideshows with synchronous and asynchronous engagement)
- [ ] I would like this proposal to be considered for both formats.

**Please disclose any conflicts of interest, if applicable.**
