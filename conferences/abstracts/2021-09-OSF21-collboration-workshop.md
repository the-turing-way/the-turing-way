## Abstract
*Summary of your proposal; maximum 300 words. The abstract should be a concise summary of the session content, audience, format and the relation to the overall objective of the conference. You can copy and paste this into the submission system at the time of submission.*

Data science and research is defined by its interdisciplinarity. Our work can only reach its highest potential if there are diverse teams of people involved in designing and delivering the research or products. Effective methods of collaboration are crucial to the success and sustainability of research projects and communities. 
The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led book project that aims to bring together diverse contributors and collaborators to share resources and practices that make data science reproducible, ethical and inclusive. The project is developed and maintained on an online project repository (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) and invites contributions to its 5 guides, including the Guide for Collaboration.
We believe that to make our project widely beneficial and comprehensive we need to collaborate with individuals and groups with diverse skills, backgrounds, lived experiences and domain knowledge. Our community members currently include over 270 contributors on GitHub, as well as thousands of users worldwide who write, read, review, enhance and promote best practices in data science and research (in academia, industry, open communities and public sector). 

In this session, we will introduce the Guide for Collaboration to discuss good practices for effective and inclusive collaboration. We will demonstrate The Turing Way guides to prompt discussions on developing inclusive engagement pathways and setting Community-led projects that are open for contributions from people with diverse skills. Through this discussion, we will highlight the importance of designing projects for inclusion and distributed collaboration. Participants will leave this session having discovered skills around reviewing team memberâ€™s contributions, remote working, running inclusive events/meetings, defining explicit expectations, and participatory co-creation.

## Conference Themes
*Select the conference theme(s) your proposal best addresses (remove the others):*

Interdisciplinary collaborations: Networks, services, methods
- Sharing best practices and knowledge
- Training and skills for open science
- Sustaining open science training: people, resources, governance
- Skills within the wider research context

## Keywords
*List 3-4 key terms that describe the subject of the proposal.*

Collaboration, data science, inclusion, 

## Audience
Anyone who is collaborating with others on projects is welcome to join. For example, policy makers, funders, researchers, support staff, publishers, librarians, research administrators. 

## Session content, format and draft agenda,
* What you will cover in the workshop and why will your topic be of interest to the intended audience? 
  * This workshop will cover the topic of Collaboration and is welcome to anyone that would like to share their insights on collaborating. 

* Does your session have a global or a continental/regional coverage?
  * The workshop particularly welcomes participants from regions where the Turing Way currently still has limited contributors, which is Africa and Australasia.   

* Include a description of the format(s) of your workshop - e.g., tutorial sessions, group discussion, panel discussion, hands-on exercises with online interactive tools or a mix of formats. 
  * The workshop will start with an introduction of the Turing Way and the Collaboration Guide (15 min?), which is followed by a group discussion using collaborative notes (Google Docs) (remainder of the 90 mins). 

## Learning outcomes
*Briefly state the learning outcomes from your workshop.*

* Session attendees will have the opportunity to learn about collaboration in research projects and contribute their expertise. In Particular, we will talk about interdisciplinary, global and asynchronous collaboration. 
* Participants will learn where to find more resources on the topic of collaboration using The Turing Way and how to contribute to this interdisciplinary community/project.

## Length and number of attendees 
* 90 minutes
* 15-30? attendees
