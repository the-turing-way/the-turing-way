## Ideas from the November Sprint

#### Why do reproducible research
- For yourself
- For everyone else

#### Git & Version Control
- Version Control - what is it and why use it. (Or xx_final_Final.docx *is* version control, but you can do better.)
- Your first project using Git
- Accessing previous versions of your code
- Branches and Merging
- Semantic Versioning - Tags and releases (and how that fits in with trad publishing DOIs)

#### Collaborating through Github
- Commenting and documenting projects
- How to write a good README
- How to write good commit messages
- Anatomy of a github repo
- Using Pull requests
- How to use cloud-based tools to power-up your repo (e.g. cloud-based CI see below)

#### Testing for research
- Why should you test your code?
- What is a good test
- End-to-end testing vs. Unit Testing & other types.

#### Data Management
- Documenting Data
- Open (FAIR) Standards

#### Reproducible Compute Environments
- Packaging code for re-use (containers)
- Managing Dependences
- Continuous Integration (and available tools)
- Random Seeds & Dealing with Stochastic simulations (e.g. due to floating point errors)
- Reproducible Research for HPC Projects

#### Getting Credit for Reproducible Research

#### Licensing For re-use

#### Definition of Reproducibility
- How does reproducibility overlap with Open

#### Reproducible as a team 
- Roles in a reproducible project
- Maintaining reproducibility as a group

#### Barriers to Reproducibility

#### A reproducible paper

#### Your Working Environment
- Introduction to the command line
- Alternatives to the Command Line
- Interactive Development Environments
- Jupyter Notebooks (and common issues)

#### Ethics
- Dealing with Sensitive Data
- Getting Consent for Data Sharing
- Ethics Approval @ the Turing

#### Scoping a data project
- What makes a good data science project
