**How would you like to develop this project?**

We would like to build on the success of the Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards. Initial projects and feedback from Crick partners have indicated that there is a strong need to develop introductory training materials/resources on good data science practice/reproducible research for experimental biomedical scientists of all skill levels and for early career researchers. Similar feedback has been received via the Turing ‘omics interest group indicating that there is a need for foundational training for the wider cell and molecular biology community.
We would like to meet this need and develop a short “Turing-Crick Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists” training course. We will work collaboratively with the Crick scientists and wider Turing omics research community and build on / tailor the existing material from The Turing Way project on reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science. As an open source project, The Turing Way engages with a community of over 270 contributors to build and maintain resources on good data science practices, as well as promote a culture of collaboration to positively impact data research culture.
Our aim will be to provide accessible training material that is openly available to anyone to repurpose and promote good practice throughout the experimental communities. 
 
We are particularly interested in projects that showcase: (1) data integration and/or model linking; (2) good data science practice; (3) effective visualisation and/or communication to stakeholders. How would the proposed project development highlight these areas?
The proposed project directly addresses: (2) good data science practice; and (3) effective visualisation and/or communication to stakeholders. Our aim will be to present unfamiliar or complex material to experimentalists in a relatable and easily accessible way. By collaboratively developing this project with domain experts and sharing it openly, we will demonstrate and establish a culture of good data science practice within experimental communities. In building this project, we will embed the 'Tools, practices and systems' (TPS) programme’s core values: build trustworthy systems; embed transparent reporting practices; promote inclusive interoperable design; maintain ethical integrity and encourage respectful co-creation.
 
This project extension will leverage strategic engagement between the Turing Institute and 1) The Carpentries and 2) Open Life Science. These two communities are world leaders in training diverse communities in data science and software development skills. Our shared investments in good data science practice will be leveraged in conversations with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to scope a strategic partnership with the Institute.

**How would the proposed project development have cross-theme impact?**
This is a joint submission from the Health and TPS themes. 
We will also engage and collaborate with scientists from across the Turing, particularly via the Turing’s Omics data generation and analysis interest group.
Although the training course will be tailored to the biomedical sciences community, there will be overlap with the cell and molecular biology communities. We will engage with the data science for science theme in order to maximize cross-theme impact. Moreover, The Turing Way members will maintain and share materials with domain-independent research practices that are transferable across themes.
What resources are needed for the project development? (approximately)
We anticipate that in designing the course will draw from previously produced material, particularly from The Turing way, contextualised for the biomedical science community via engagement with Crick and omics group researchers. Key to the success will be facilitation by the community managers (The Turing Way and ASG), Research Application Managers (RAMs) and the leadership in community development of Malvika Sharan, who is the Community Manager and (from July 2021) co-lead investigator of The Turing Way project that is already being funded by the ASG TPS theme.
To make material that is relatable to experimentalists, we will draw on domain expertise from the Crick and Turing Health communities. This idea has already been discussed with both the steering group of the Turing-Crick partnership and Turing omics research community. Both groups were enthusiastic and keen to support.

In addition, the proposed project will need the following resources:
- REG resources – to help develop and present case studies in an intuitive format that is accessible to experimentalists (0.5 person for 6 months).
- TheTuring Way community manager - to coordinate the development and delivery of the case studies, as well as develop and implement the dissemination plans for all the output generated in this project (0.2 person time for 6 months).
- Graphic designer and illustrator – to help prepare training material in an attractive, professional and engaging format (contractors)

**Do you have someone in mind to conduct this work? If yes, please provide their details and when they would be available to start. Does this person consider themselves to be a member of an underrepresented group in STEM / Data Science?**

Recruitment for a Community Manager is planned in the next few months for The Turing Way as well as for ASG.

**If you do not have someone in mind to conduct this work, what person specification requirements would be needed to develop the project?**
We would like to hire a graphic designer on a contract basis to help prepare the training material.
     
We will pair the materials with scientific illustrations, designed to enhance accessibility and engage with a diverse audience. We request 2 days of a scientific illustrator from ‘Scriberia’ (£2180 per day). All illustrations will be made available under a free license as demonstrated here by The Turing Way: https://zenodo.org/record/4906004.
