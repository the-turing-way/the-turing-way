### Brief title for your event

Building capacity for diverse and sustainable Jupyter contributions within the UK

### Describe the goal/topic of the event

Our goal is to build connections between current Jovyans in the UK and develop a roadmap to broaden participation across the Jupyter ecosystem.
We will run a two day workshop for 25 existing contributors to Project Jupyter and a one day mentored contribution sprint for around 30 new contributors from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.

Although we will not be able to answer them, we hope to stimulate conversations around:

* What is a contribution to Jupyter?
* What does a Jupyter contributor look like?
* How do we meet each other and how can we mentor our colleagues to share their knowledge effectively?
* How do we fund these activities and maintain healthy workloads within the ecosystem?

The event will be co-hosted by the Alan Turing Institute and Microsoft UK.
The Alan Turing Institute is the UK's national institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
It provides a hub between researchers, instructors, librarians and policy makers in UK universities, industry partners such as Accenture, HSBC, Siemens and Lloyds Register Foundation, and government agencies including the the National Health Service, the Ministry of Defence, and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
The Institute seeks to bring cutting edge research methods, tools, practices and systems to address real-world problems.
It can only achieve this mission by sharing knowledge and expertise across its diverse community of stakeholders: an identical challenge to the long term sustainability of the Jupyter ecosystem.

We have three specific goals for this event:

1. Form a UK Jupyter contributors community to facilitate sustained contributions to the whole of the Jupyter ecosystem.
2. Map and identify the most common barriers limiting participation and onboarding to Jupyter projects, and develop a roadmap of processes and improvements to help lower said barriers.
3. Run a mentored sprint for diverse beginners event to support members of traditionally underrepresented groups who are interested in contributing to Jupyter but have encountered barriers to participation in the past.

These three goals complement each other and, at the same time, cover several cycles of research, strategic planning and active contribution to the Jupyter ecosystem.

### How does the workshop involve strategic work related to the central open-standards, protocols, abstractions and architecture, and open-source subprojects of Project Jupyter?

Sustainability is a significant challenge faced by open-source projects and communities.
Having transparent and robust processes and mechanisms for community onboarding and participation is critical to ensure the long-term sustainability and adoption of Project Jupyter products and services.
Our goal is to support current community leaders, maintainers and core developers by reviewing and enhancing existing mechanisms to improve community participation.

Improving the bus-factor of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem is a high strategic priority for a community that has achieved so much in such a short period of time.
Perhaps counter-intuitively, one of the greatest ways to support the mental health of current contributors and maintainers is to ensure they are replaceable, that they can leave at any time.
Two mechanisms to maintain healthy workloads for volunteer community members are 1) improve pathways through which new folks are empowered to join and lead Jupyter teams, and 2) broaden the definition of a contribution to include all the activities covering maintenance and growth of an open source project: documentation, advocacy and marketing, policy and governance, and user experience research expertise.

Improving governance and interoperability across the various projects within the Jupyter ecosystem is an important strategic goal that requires specific business management and communications expertise.
Professionals with these skills often do not see themselves represented in open source community leaders - where technical expertise tends to dominate - and therefore self-select out of the potential contributor pool.
As with the Google Summer of Code expanding to include the Google Season of Docs, it is necessary for Project Jupyter to specifically recruit expertise in community and project management.
The result of more effective communication within Project Jupyter will be enhanced if the new contributors themselves represent a diverse community.

Supporting and empowering members of the most underrepresented and marginalised groups is not only a moral imperative but crucial to building a genuinely diverse and inclusive community.
Implementations developed by people from multiple perspectives and lived experiences is one of the most effective ways to dismantle barriers to participation and adoption.
As an open source project developing open tools and infrastructure for the global community, having specific outreach and mentorship programmes in place to achieve this goal is a crucial part of Jupyter's mission.

### "How will the workshop lead to the growth and sustainability of the Jupyter community? How will it grow the size and health of the core Jupyter project contributor community? Of the broader Jupyter ecosystem of which Jupyter is a part?"

This workshop will nurture the Jupyter community in at least four ways:

1. A local UK contributor community will foster further contributions, such as technical development, advocacy, institutional adoption, and funding, to support the Jupyter mission.
  Focusing on a regional community will facilitate continual in-person interactions among community contributors, and coordinated funding applications and advocacy mechanisms.
2. Participants who have contributed in very different ways across the Jupyter ecosystem will share similarities and differences of their experiences.
  We will feedback these observations to the Jupyter Governance team and support initiatives to harmonise and improve the contributing experience across sub-projects for new contributors and existing maintainers alike.
3. We will grow the contributor community by identifying participation barriers and mechanisms to lower or eliminate challenges that new contributors face when choosing to contribute to Jupyter.
  We will focus on improving the recruitment and onboarding experience for new contributors from across academia, industry, and government.
4. The mentored sprint, specifically designed to support a diverse group of new contributors, will build a supportive network who can provide peer support, advocacy to other members of underrepresented groups, and feedback to the Jupyter community on how to best grow a health and inclusive community.

### "What types of people would attend the event and why does their participation align with the goals of Jupyter Workshops in general and your particular goals for this workshop?"

The two day workshop will consist of current Jupyter contributors, users and advocates to the Jupyter ecosystem.
This includes researchers, research software engineers, decision-makers, journal publishers and editors, librarians, and educators who have committed to sharing their expertise at the workshop if this proposal is funded.
Participants who have helped to design and build this application include (in alphabetical order):

* Tania Allard: Senior Developer Advocate at Microsoft UK and Fellow for the Python Software Foundation, organiser of mentored sprints for diverse beginners since 2017.
* Evelina Gabasova: Principle Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute and Microsoft "Most Valuable Profssional" in Developer Technologies since 2016.
* Sarah Gibson: Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute and operator for Project Binder and mybinder.org.
* Tony Hirst: Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing and Communications at The Open University and editor of the Tracking Jupyter newsletter.
* Iain Hrynaszkiewicz: Publisher in Open Research at PLOS interested in incorporating open infrastructure into academic publishing.
* Ian Hawke: Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Southampton with five years experience teaching (live coding and previously created) with Jupyter notebooks Teaching (live coding and prepping teaching materials).
* Martin O'Reilly: Director of Research Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute and lead investigator for data safe havens in the cloud which facilitates secure data science using open infrastructure.
* Tomas Petricek: Lecturer in the School of Computing and lead developer of Wrattler, an extensible, reproducible and polyglot notebook which can be accessed as an extension for JupyterLab.
* Ian Stuart and Bert Robberechts: Software Engineers at EDINA, the centre for digital expertise and online service delivery at the University of Edinburgh, JupyterHub service providers, contributors to nbgrader, and experts in accessibility work for Jupyter notebooks.
* Kirstie Whitaker: Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute and lead developer of The Turing Way, a series of Jupyter Books detailing open and inclusive data science practices.

We have designed the two day workshop to support 25 participants (10 from London, 15 from around the UK).
If this application is funded we will recruit experienced Jupyter contributors across the UK to ensure the conversation is representative of as diverse a community as possible.

**These participants support our goal of building connections of existing Jupyter community members within the UK to facilitate and grow contributions in the future.**

At least eight of the workshop participants will be asked to stay to support between 25 and 30 new contributors at the mentored sprint.
These people will likely be members of other open source communities who are passionate about Project Jupyter but have never contributed, or team members in STEM fields who have relevent expertise but who have never contributed to open source projects.
We will select these participants through an open and transparent application process that will prioritise participation of black and indigenous people of colour (BIPOC), LGBTQ+ people, disabled and neurodivergent people, people from low socioeconomic status groups, and people with non-technical expertise (such as marketing, advocacy, documentation, communication and project management).

**These participants support our goal of bringing in new contributors to the Jupyter community and removing barriers to their participation through specific mentored support.**

### How does the event reach users/contributors that are underserved or underrepresented in our community?

We will reach out to those already contributing to the Jupyter ecosystem within the UK and proactively invite those that are from underrepresented groups.
The organisers have extensive connections within the Turing Institute's network of 13 partner universities and industry and government partners, the UK Software Sustainability Institute, Microsoft's UK network, the PyCon UK community, the British Library's network, and multiple other open source and data library communities.
We will also promote the event through the Tracking Jupyter and Turing Way newsletters.

By organising a mentored sprint for diverse beginners we will onboard, mentor and include those from an under-represented background that have encountered participation barriers in the past.
We will invite and approach user groups serving underrepresented groups to attend the sprint as well as to share the event with their members.
Groups we will promote to include: AI gender minority, One Health Tech, Queer in tech, ResearcHers Code, Trans Who Code, Black Women Code, Women in Data Science, Women Who Code, the UK Pyladies chapter and the UK Rladies chapters.
We will continue to grow this list during the application period, and make sure that the application timeline is sufficient to include people who need more time to plan travel or work on weekend days.

We understand that planning a work event on a Saturday excludes many potential contributors.
However, organising events on week days also excludes people who do not have institutional support to volunteer their time to Project Jupyter.
The budget we have provided assumes the maximum travel and hotel costs for workshop participants, along with travel funds for ten of the workshop participants (we assume that many of the participants will be travelling from within London to the event).
We will use the excess funds to provide childcare and additional support for mentored sprint participants.

### All events funded by Jupyter require the adoption and enforcement of our Code of Conduct. Do you agree to serve as our proxy to address any COC complaints that may arise at the event? *

Yes

### Is there any other information you'd like for us to consider?

This event is UK focused in order to facilitate and coordinate contributions to Jupyter within a small(ish) geographic region in which participants are likely to request support from similar funding agencies.
However, the UK has just voted for a right-wing nationalist government that will expedite the UK leaving the European Union.
We - the organisers of this event - do not support any actions that make research and innovation harder, particularly for members of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields.
We would like to use this space to reiterate our commitment to a European and global scientific community, and that we will continue to work to reduce barriers to participation for all.
