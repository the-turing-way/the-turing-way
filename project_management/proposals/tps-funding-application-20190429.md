### Abstract

*Max 500 words*

_The Turing Way_ is currently a handbook for reproducible data science (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
This work package will extend _The Turing Way_ into a series of books: "A How To Guide to Data Science", with the current book being one of them.
Our goal is to capture the vast amounts of knowledge of data science practices from within the Turing community and beyond.
Following an open source, community driven approach, we will welcome contributions from anyone who can support researchers and practitioners in learning or improving the "how" of conducting world-leading research in data science and artificial intelligence (AI).
The funding will support a research engineer (1 FTE, 18 months) with expertise in authoring documentation, training, and community building to manage contributions to the books, and four "book dash" events to engage the broader _Turing Way_ community.

Reproducibility is important, and multifaceted.
The book currently has chapters on research data management, version control, reproducible computational environments, testing, and continuous integration.
But reproducibility does not cover core data science practices such as:
* Is the scientific question is appropriately scoped?
* Are statistical assumptions correctly managed?
* Was a suitable algorithm or model applied?
* How do results vary according to differences across systems?
* What is the effect of choice of random seeds?
* How do visualisations change the interpretation?

Furthermore, the book does not currently include the aspects of data science and AI that define whether work was ethically designed and reported.
By curating this knowledge in an accessible format, _The Turing Way_ series will support the Turing Institute's goals of delivering world class research, training the leaders of tomorrow, and leading the public conversation.

_The Turing Way_ will not replace academic journals or software packages. 
It is a pedagogical opportunity, a translation of research outputs into curated tutorials, case studies and checklists.
The books are Jupyter Books (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book) which build and host web content directly from markdown files or jupyter notebooks in a GitHub repository.
They are easy to version control, edit and extend.
The notebooks are interactive via a Binder plugin (https://mybinder.org).

The _Turing Way_ community is a global collaboration of research engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and domain expert researchers at all levels of seniority.
Anyone can contribute to the book at any time and our community manager will provide 1:1 mentorship for anyone who wants to incorporate their knowledge into the books.
We will focus on inclusion and creativity at our four "book dash" events.
These one day sprints allow us to bring together a diverse group to co-create a useful and usable resource.
Participants will add new chapters, review content for clarity across multiple domains of expertise, and create personalised pathways through the book series to add value to as broad a community as possible.

Metrics of success over 18 months:

* 20 new chapters.
* 100 authors (significant contributions).
* 200 contributors (any contribution).
* 1000 mailing list subscribers (currently 200).
* 50 first pull requests.
* 20 new contributors to other open source projects.

### Route to impact

*Max 300 words*

We will give data scientists the resources they need to publish reproducible, accurate, interpretable, and responsible research.
We will support industry, government and third sector employees to effectively evaluate AI applications.
_The Turing Way_ books will be accessible to everyone who wants to learn technical, communication and collaboration skills, and we will adapt the content according to the needs of specific communities.

Pathways:
  * **Training Steering Group**: use of The Turing Way chapters in doctoral training, two way communication and contribution process.
  * **Book dash events**: respond to community requests for content and build confidence in early career researchers to share their skills.
  * **Research engineering and partnerships teams**: contribute chapter on effectively scoping an interdisciplinary project.

_The Turing Way_ will enable world class research by facilitating communication within interdisciplinary teams.
The chapters will cover the "bridging skills" needed for historians to collaborate with software engineers, clinicians with algorithm developers, and civil servants to develop ethical and responsible applications of AI.

Pathways:
  * **Living with machines**: encourage bidirectional community support to build a useful resource for interdisciplinary teams.
  * **Health programme**: contribute chapters on responsible data sharing, analyses within a safe haven environment, citizen science.
  * **Policy programme**: contribute chapters on ethical frameworks, bias in machine learning.

_The Turing Way_ will promote best practice in data science at a global scale.
It is a "meta-project" developed and documented openly from the start.
We will nurture a community of contributors who will themselves support a healthy and sustainable open source ecosystem.

Pathways:
  * **Jupyter and Microsoft Azure development communities**: contribute and promote _The Turing Way_ across their networks of influence (including UKRI, European Commissions, NIH), listen to "pain points" in their tools experienced by community members.
  * **Carpentries community**: co-design training materials, ensure _The Turing Way_ meets the highest pedagogical standards.

### Research challenges

*Max 300 words*

Translating knowledge across domains is always harder than it first appears. 
Tackling the *known unknowns* is the core goal of _The Turing Way_: providing a space for research teams to acquire the skills that they know they lack.
In helping experts to adopt new tools and practices, we will inevitably identify challenges that the original developers had not foreseen.
These *unknown unknowns* - or more specifically, the *unknowns that we thought we knew* - will generate exciting new research opportunities.

Already identified challenges include:

* **Datasets in different applications domains vary greatly in size.**
  Turing researchers Imanol Perez Arribas and Terry Lyons adapted statistical analyses from financial forecasting (large dataset) to categorising mental health disorders (small dataset).
  In both the data cannot be shared for independent verification.
  * How do we ensure the ethical and statistical rigor of work when data cannot be collected or reviewed?
* **Tools, practices and systems of data science are moving incredibly quickly.**
  Turing doctoral student Alex Campbell spent three months using Tensorflow with neuroimaging data, only to discover that the framework did not provide the necessary functionality.
  While he rewrote the code in Pytorch, Tensorflow implemented the required feature enhancements.
  * How do we provide guidance on best practices when the tools we use are constantly shifting?
* **The publish or perish incentive system limits progress.**
 It is possible to archive and publish software and data papers, assign them digital object identifiers, and track their citations.
 However, these outputs are not commonly considered in research career progression and lack funding.
  * How do we support people through the current change in academic culture?

The _Turing Way_ community will support - as co-authors if appropriate - research projects that seek to push back the boundaries of what can be done in transparent, ethical, reproducible, and innovative data science.

### Community benefit

*Max 300 words*

_The Turing Way_ will benefit expert researchers in Data Science and AI.
It will provide them with a platform to share their expertise with a broad audience.
In curating tutorials and best practice guidelines, _The Turing Way_ will help to translate recommendations from the areas in which they were developed, to a much larger body of potential research, industry and government applications.

_The Turing Way_ will reduce the amount of time that life-long learners spend figuring out how they should answer their scientific question.
This online, searchable, and interactive handbook will pave the way for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, research engineers and senior academics to adopt practices across traditional domain boundaries.
The Turing research community will be more efficient and effective in conducting transparent, ethical, reproducible, and verifiable research.

The Turing business team will benefit from _The Turing Way_.
The checklists and project design resources will benefit the programme managers and partnerships team.
Resources such as equitable recruitment processes, dynamic presentation guidelines, writing for policy makers, and recommendations for secure password management - internally developed by the business team -  can all be incorporated into _The Turing Way_.
More generally, we will educate the broader community on the best practices for knowledge sharing: making information FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

_The Turing Way_ will benefit the global open source community.
All materials are shared under an open licence and can be re-used, re-mixed and adapted as needed by anyone and for any purpose.
This work package will deliver continued support to all community members on navigating GitHub issues, git branches and forks, commits and reviews, and their first pull requests.
We will track the improvements in skills and confident required to contribute to other projects and thus to sustain an open source ecosystem.
