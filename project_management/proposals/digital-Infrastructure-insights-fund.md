# 2023 Digital Infrastructure Insights Fund RFP


**Call for Proposals:** [2023 Digital Infrastructure Insights Fund RFP](https://fordfoundation.forms.fm/2023-digital-infrastructure-insights-fund-rfp/forms/9724/)

**Deadline:** 1 Oct 2023

Written by (alphabetical order): Batool Almarzouq, Arielle Bennett, Melissa Black, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, Malvika Sharan, Elisabeth Wadge and Kirstie Whitaker

### Q1: What is your research question? 
(max 30 words)

What inclusive localisation and governance practices, delivered through sustainably maintained digital-infrastructure like The Turing Way, can promote diversity of language and contributors in open source, enhancing knowledge access and equity?


### Q2: Why is this question important to answer and how does it relate to our fund? (max 500 words)

Our proposal strongly aligns with four of your Fund’s interests:

* Global Shifts & Localization: Demographics and further narratives of maintainership;
* The Human Infrastructure in Digital Infrastructure;
* Sectoral Adoption & Usage of Open Source from Basic Research to Field Work and Operations;
* Social, Material, Environmental (...) Dimensions of Sustainability.

Advances in science must reflect the breadth of humanity if they are to serve all of humanity equally. Open source research has the potential to encompass a broad and expanding community. However, most resources are produced in English, disadvantaging and excluding largely non-English speaking members of the community from the process of knowledge access, production and sharing. The existing gap in open source multilingual practices creates and perpetuates divides between global communities. The solutions for addressing these go beyond improving access to these resources: we must make knowledge culturally and contextually suitable for different communities through stronger research-based localisation efforts. Closing this gap is critical to encouraging wider participation and leadership in open source by everyone who wants to take part, regardless of language, nationality or sector. 

Localisation is more than text-to-text translation. Localisation means making knowledge relevant to different communities, each with its unique cultural contexts. By researching the subtleties of localisation practices, we will continue to uncover complex narratives of who builds and who benefits from open source resources. We will highlight evidence of how global shifts in the evolving narratives of maintainership affect the spread of knowledge. In open science communities, we must continually address the role of diversity of thoughts and experiences in refining more inclusive, fairer approaches to knowledge production and sharing.

The governance of community-led localisation is a challenging problem. We must consider time zones, spoken and written language, culture-specific communication styles, power dynamics and socio-economic variation in who can undertake unpaid labour. The people who translate and localise open source materials are an often overlooked  human component of the digital infrastructure. We can only build towards more equitable and accessible science through participatory governance that dismantles existing power structures and replaces them with decision-making processes that include those currently marginalised.

The dynamic nature of localising open source knowledge across multiple languages means we need robust, flexible, extendable and sustainable digital infrastructure. There is often an unspoken assumption that knowledge flows only from English to other languages. This assumption overlooks the richness and diversity of insights that are gained from multiple languages and cultures through international contributors, and does not provide a mechanism that acknowledges and empowers community members who do not speak the dominant language. We must create and promote practices that do not perpetuate imbalances between the members/communities using dominant and marginalised languages respectively. The goal is to build open source infrastructures enabling multidirectional knowledge flow that prioritises knowledge equity and global accessibility. This will help to realise our vision of social and digital sustainability, where all community members can contribute to and benefit from global expertise.


### Q3: What research methods will you use to answer this question? (max 500 words)

To undertake research across three themes, we will use four qualitative research methods:

* Desk-based research/literature review;
* Focus groups and individual interviews;
* Iterative development and emergent design;
* Participatory co-creation.

**Theme 1: Exploring culturally appropriate localisation practices.**

To understand culturally appropriate localisation practices, we will initiate a literature review in translation studies and related domains, such as science and technology studies. We will extend this review by analysing existing localisation guidelines and frameworks. We will undertake individual interviews to bring together diverse insights and gather potential solutions to these challenges. We will systematically collect feedback from our own team to integrate our experiences with those of others in the global translation and localisation community. Our goal is to define and communicate established practices, challenges and opportunities in localisation within open source projects.

We will work openly, communicating our learnings as we collect them, and invite participation throughout the project. We will thus follow an emergent design methodology to allow our results to evolve and adapt in response to new learnings and community inputs.

**Theme 2: Defining inclusive governance strategies.**

We are committed to refining our governance strategies continuously, ensuring they match the diverse needs of our community members. We will co-create inclusive governance strategies for community-led localisation. We include in this work the technical mechanisms of tracking distributed contributions and acknowledging that work appropriately. 

Our investigations will always involve dimensions of power. We will conduct individual interviews and focus group sessions to gain deeper insights into the community’s experiences and needs. We will identify how our research methods are perpetuating or dismantling power imbalances in existing governance structures, and use reflective and iterative techniques to involve as broad and diverse participation as possible. Our analysis will seek to refine governance strategies to be more inclusive and considerate of our community’s diverse needs, and to lay the groundwork for other communities to adapt our learnings for their own context and needs.

**Theme 3. Sustainable maintenance of digital infrastructure.**

We work on The Turing Way, a handbook for reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive data science. To date the project has more than 400 contributors. The handbook is originally written in English and is continually being expanded, reviewed and edited, to accommodate linguistic evolutions and modify content that requires some specific context to be understood and translated.  During localisation, the content  further diverges as it accommodates each language's characteristics and cultural nuances.

Our workflows and digital infrastructure must be able to facilitate regular updates, maintain the designed divergences across language versions, and track diverse contributions. The set of open source tools used in The Turing Way solves some but not all of these requirements. We will lead a dedicated taskforce to streamline the multilingual implementation across these tools, using emergent design principles to implement recommendations from user interviews and bug reports. We will share our learnings on how to integrate and maintain multiple languages, making sure each version is coherent, contextually relevant, and user-friendly.


### Q4: What data or other resources will you use to answer the question? (max 500 words)

Our research will be conducted through [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) which is both a handbook and an open source community. The development of this interactive online educational resource happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-turing-way) under open source licences (MIT and CC-BY). Our community handbook details current engagement practices, including how to support [the localisation working group](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/translation). One of the localisation working group leads, Melissa Black, will spearhead the research.

We already have a Slack channel with more than 800 members. To examine the nuances of localisation, we will engage with individuals from diverse communities, each with a rich history and ongoing efforts in this domain. Their collective wisdom and experiences will be the linchpin in enriching our research. We will connect with them through The Turing Way community and through our community partners (detailed below).

The Turing Way translation team recognises the challenge of fostering culturally appropriate localisation practices. There are ongoing conversations on how to work with subteams for each language while holding space for groups from several countries to collaboratively build their own localisation guidelines. To consider such valuable input in the research and infrastructure workflows, we will review anonymised notes from community forums and discuss the efficacy of governance strategies used by localisation co-leads.

We will follow the data collection and processing policies of The Alan Turing Institute, the institutional host of The Turing Way project. Existing data will be used based on the licence through which it is available. For The Turing Way and most of our community partners that is a Creative Commons attribution (CC-BY) licence. Data collected as part of the focus groups or individual interviews will be processed through multiple layers of data anonymisation, and the consent form for all interviewees will detail the confidentiality of their contributions. They will be invited to make specific quotes publicly available as a resource for future research, but not required to do so. An example of this workflow is available through the [AutSPACEs project](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-information/data-management.md), another open source research project hosted by The Alan Turing Institute.

We will be working closely with The Turing Way’s infrastructure working group on their approaches to code review and user testing. This is an open source project that takes into account the benefits of working openly. Thus, the tools used in the localisation and deployment workflows are interoperable and open source or open-source friendly. We will consult documentation for platforms such as Crowdin (our current chosen translation management system, [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) to build and host documentation and workflows to accommodate multi-deployment through languages.

The project will apply for ethical approval through The Alan Turing Institute’s research ethics panel. Work on the literature review and review of existing frameworks will start as soon as funding is available. New data collection will not begin until the ethics panel approves the project.


### Q5: If applicable: What is the research finding that you are moving into practice? (500 words)

The core of scientific communication is heavily centred around English, a critical issue highlighted by numerous research papers, including “Communicating science in English” by Huttner-Koros, A., and Perera (2016). This bias creates a barrier for the participation of non-native English speakers in the production of knowledge and imposes on them numerous burdens across the whole research cycle (Amano et al 2023). Individuals who do not speak or read English are additionally excluded from contributing to the international community, and meaningful knowledge exchange with them necessitates grassroots intervention from English-speaking members, along with the dedicated work of translators and interpreters. The international community also experiences a loss when knowledge articulated in languages other than English is disregarded, as shown by the exclusion of non-English studies demonstrating the effectiveness of conservation interventions globally (Amano et al 2021). Conveying scientific practices and communications properly is thus impossible without extensive localisation efforts. Resources and methodologies developed with a Western and English-centric approach require careful adaptation to be meaningful and applicable in diverse local contexts, to ensure their relevance and appropriateness across different cultural and linguistic landscapes.

Digging deeper into the disparities and biases in scientific communication, the imbalance between the Global North and the Global South becomes clearly evident, especially within open source communities. ["Contextualising Openness: Situating Open Science"](https://idrc-crdi.ca/sites/default/files/openebooks/Contextualizing-Openness/9781552506110.html) underscores the urgency of correcting the asymmetry in global knowledge production and access. It calls for the democratisation of knowledge and a rethinking of the power relations within our knowledge infrastructure. Advancing towards open science is crucial in mitigating the repercussions of such disparities on global development practices. However, this advancement requires a reassessment of digital infrastructure and its maintenance, bringing to light the varied opportunities and challenges present across different regions.

Our research aims to explore key questions such as: How can open knowledge be localised to align with diverse realities and knowledge systems? How can we improve governance in digital infrastructure to ensure equitable participation and representation from varied contexts and regions? How can we advocate for digital infrastructure and its maintenance to be more inclusive and equitable, contributing to knowledge equity in the open source knowledge landscape?

In addressing these questions, our work will improve the current infrastructure tools for scientific publishing, such as Jupyter Book, highlighting their limitations in localisation and maintenance for different languages. Ultimately we aim to improve communication and maintenance of open source educational resources in multiple languages, ensuring each version is coherent and contextually relevant. By conducting user experience studies, we will gain insights into how users and contributors interact with the localised versions of the digital infrastructure and to identify areas that require improvement or enhancement. Our careful maintenance will not only enhance accessibility and knowledge exchange within the community, but also enable other communities to reuse and build upon it, fostering a more inclusive and equitable scientific communication landscape.


### Q6 What is the specific context / project / community that will be targeted with your research or its implementation - and why is the intervention needed?  (max 500 words)

The Turing Way, incubated at The Alan Turing Institute, was funded from the UK Government’s strategic priority fund investment to help change the culture of data science. Its five guides (covering best practice in reproducibility, ethics, collaboration, communication and project design) already have a significant audience: as of September 2023, 300+ chapters have been written by 450+ contributors from all continents, incorporating third-sector, industry and academic perspectives. [Images](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807) released for free re-use have been collectively downloaded over 22,000 times.

The project has influenced policymakers: it was used as a best practice use case in the Goldacre review (2022) commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; it was recommended by the Foundation for Dutch Scientific Research Institutes and Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration; it was cited in the Mayor of London’s adopted Technology Charter for London; and it is often cited in other disciplines. It won the 2022 Award for Belonging from OpenUK. It has inspired similar projects, including the Office of National Statistics data scientists’ own internal handbook, [the FAIR Cookbook](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/news/the-fair-cookbook-a-guide-for-your-data-fairification-journey/), and [the Environmental Data Science Book](https://the-environmental-ds-book.netlify.com). Project members are participating in advising NASA’s Transform to Open Science programme.

But its influence goes further via its community’s non-native English speakers. Engaged members of international organisations such as LA-CoNGA physics (multiple South American countries), ARPHAI (Argentina), University of São Paulo (Brazil), APHRC (Kenya) and Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA) are active contributors and have helped expand the reach of The Turing Way in Global South communities. 

From its beginnings, community members worked to translate the book into their native languages, in efforts that were frequently isolated and depended on time availability. To build on this work, a localisation working group was formed in 2021, offering support, visibility, and continuity to these efforts. Currently facilitating translations in 8 languages, the group conducts bi-weekly coworking calls and engages in international conferences like Write The Docs, CarpentriesCons, FORCE11, FOSS, and Durham RIOTS Club. The Turing Way localisation working group has put significant effort into two aspects. One is the team’s **governance**, to co-govern the human infrastructure mobilised in the localisation efforts, and ensure that everyone involved is acknowledged, consulted and included. The second is **infrastructure** integration,** **the technical publishing tools used in our workflows. Each team is encouraged to create localisation guidelines to record decisions around technical jargon, cultural nuance, and other considerations (such as gender-neutral expressions in gendered languages). A deployment in Arabic can be seen at [here](https://turingway-arabic.netlify.app/welcome.html), and the [corresponding localisation guidelines](https://github.com/TWTranslation/Arabic-specific-Translation-rules). 

Our proposal will gather information about governance practices that help us improve the current structure and learn from communities encountering similar situations. It will also integrate the tools used because the current workflow is not smooth and the multilingual deployment has not been solved. Given the widespread use of Quarto and Jupyter Book in scientific and technical publishing, resolving integration issues will not only enhance localisation within The Turing Way but also alleviate similar challenges for other communities.


### Q7: Please summarize your proposed work and the key activities that you will undertake (max 500 words)

Our project will result in these proposed deliverables:

**D0: Development of Theory of Change and indicators** The Theory of Change will be a foundational framework outlining the long- and short-term outcomes, assumptions and indicators. It will serve as a precursor and guiding document for all subsequent deliverables, ensuring alignment with the overarching goals and impact.

**D1: Localisation toolkit published in The Turing Way** This will offer resources, tools and guidelines for initiating and managing community-led localisation projects. Our mission is to empower the members in our open source community by providing resources, tools and guidelines for initiating and managing inclusive community-led localisation.

**D2: Interoperable multi-language glossary and translation memory (or shared translation dictionaries)** A shareable and interoperable multi-language glossary and translation memory will be designed to facilitate community-led translation initiatives. This resource will emphasise acknowledgment and citation, allowing different communities to build and enhance it collaboratively.

**D3: Academic paper on challenges and opportunities in open-source community-led localisation** We will elevate the experiences of localisation experts (whose experiences are often marginalised in the academic literature) with a goal of promoting global accessibility and knowledge equity through inclusive governance strategies and culturally appropriate localisation practices.

**D4: Community engagement and governance strategy for The Turing Way translation and localisation working group. **This work will also provide templates for various governance structures that are adaptable to the different localisation needs of diverse communities, aiding in the implementation of structured and organised localisation initiatives.

**D5: Digital infrastructure documentation and enhanced infrastructure for localisation** This deliverable will also be linked to the deliverables around governance strategy (D4) and community engagement for localisation (D1). Specifically, D5 will include advancing work to deploy multiple translations in a coherent workflow rather than following separate pipelines for each language, and developing acknowledgement tools to track work outside GitHub commits.

Our overview timeline is split into four three-month segments:

Qtr1: Develop and submit ethics application (all Ds), develop theory of change (D0), conduct literature review (D1, D3, D4), analyse existing resources (all Ds), create project plan for interviews and focus groups (all Ds), advance known technical challenges (D5) (for example: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3184].

Qtr2: Conduct interviews and focus groups (all Ds), collect feedback from The Turing Way community members (all Ds), write first draft of an academic paper (D3), advance technical infrastructure for multi-deployment of the book (D5), contribute to the upstream tools/infrastructure (D5).

Qtr3: Synthesise and analyse data (all Ds), finalise academic paper through community review (D3), write first draft of governance strategy and engagement guidelines (D4), create interoperable multi-language glossary and translation memory (D2).

Qtr4: Disseminate findings to broader global community (all Ds), publish localisation toolkit (D1) and the academic paper (D3).


### Q8: What partnerships and programs are critical to this work and how do you envision outreach activities? (max 400 words)

As per our community engagement practices and Guide for Collaboration, we will invite participants to co-create the work from the start. We will host a Localisation Dash, a hackathon-style event dedicated to advancing localisation efforts. The event is modelled on [The Turing Way’s successful “Book Dash” events](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) that run in a hybrid format twice a year. By sharing our methodologies and learning from the experiences of others involved in such initiatives, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of localisation in open science together.

Our outreach activities will be open to all and at least the following communities will be invited to participate:

- **The Carpentries:** With projects like *Glossario* and a global instructor community, The Carpentries unravels the complexities of extensive localisation in technical education, emphasising multi-language support and diverse lessons.

- **Galaxy Training Network and MetaDocencia:** Specialising in translating technical training materials, these communities unveil the unique challenges and methodologies in localising technical, scientific and educational content.

- **MBOA Lab** and Operas EU:** These initiatives illuminate the nuances of balancing multi-language support between English and French, focusing on content localisation for African and European communities.

- **AfricArXiv / Masakhane and LIBRE hub:** Representing African initiatives, they highlight the distinctive challenges and opportunities in localising content for African languages and cultures.

- **Wikimedia** and **rOpenSci:** These communities offer invaluable insights into scalable and sustainable localisation practices.

- **Translate Science:** This community explores the intersection of multilingualism and open science, contemplating the equitable redistribution of power within the scientific community.

- **Localisation Lab:** They localise open source projects through crowdsourcing to render them accessible in various languages.

- **The translatE project:** This explores the ways to transcend language barriers in science. Its publications contain important findings on the struggles and disadvantages of non-native English speakers in the currently dominant scientific environment.

Outreach is a foundation of our strategy to amplify our impact while promoting our contributors. We will actively participate in conferences, presenting our research outcomes and engaging with diverse communities. We will apply to present at FOSSDEM, RightsCon, MozFest, and the Software Sustainability Institute’s Collaborations Workshop. We will share our insights and learn from others, fostering a collaborative open development environment.

By integrating varied perspectives and addressing the complex challenges of localisation, our research will fortify The Turing Way as a universally resonant and accessible resource, paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable scientific community.


### Q9: What is your vision of success and what impact might your project have? (max 400 words)

Our ambition is to shape future practices in open science globally. The true measure of success for this project extends beyond the completion of deliverables such as the localisation toolkit, localised book deployments, publications, and the new governance framework and engagement guidelines. The real impact lies in the widespread adoption and implementation of our developed workflow, practices and governance model in various open source projects. We will advocate for these practices, aiming to broaden accessibility and inclusivity in the dissemination of knowledge. To articulate these short- and long-term outcomes, we will develop a Theory of Change model (D0)**,** outlining our assumptions and defining indicators of success for achieving long-lasting impact.

A dimension of success for all open source projects is to reuse learnings that already exist, and to show that “many eyes make all bugs shallow”. We collaborate with researchers and community contributors who are active in multiple communities, acting as conduits to build the practices developed in this project in solidarity across the ecosystem. For example, our collaboration with The Carpentries has enabled a reciprocal exchange of insights regarding workflow and infrastructure, allowing both communities to refine their approaches to localisation without duplicated effort.

Our work developing governance models that dismantle traditional power structures will inform future funding applications to scale our work so that people who do not have the privilege of working for free in an open source ecosystem can be reimbursed for their time. Our efforts will also articulate how people can be appropriately acknowledged for their labour.

We envision our members integrating our practices into their respective communities, becoming ambassadors in transforming cultural norms around localisation. This cascading effect is vital for cultivating an inclusive and equitable scientific ecosystem, transcending linguistic and cultural barriers. making knowledge universally accessible. Our active engagement with diverse communities positions us as catalysts for change, aligning with our overarching goal of democratising access to knowledge.
