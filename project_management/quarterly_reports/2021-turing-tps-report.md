## First Quarter: 1 January 2021 to 31 March 2021. 

### General statistics and updates:

-   The Turing Way has seen consistent growth in its community of users as well as the resources developed by the direct GitHub contributors. We currently have 39 chapters and 150 subchapters including supporting resources and templates within our five guides and a community handbook.
-   In the first quarter of 2021, we consistently hosted 2-hour long [Collaboration Cafés](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md) twice every month and 1-hr long coworking calls multiple times every week to create opportunities for the project contributors to work on The Turing Way in real-time with the team members.
-   A new weekly call was launched in February to onboard new members in the project and facilitate open discussion about the project.
-   We have 255 direct contributors to The Turing Way GitHub repository and more than 1,800 followers on Twitter, 525 newsletter subscribers and 170 members on  our Slack workspace.
-   As per the basic analytics of Netlify that provides numbers of page visitors, The Turing Way book received more than 5,000 unique users in the last 30 days (total 27,000 views). These statistics reflect a general popularity and usefulness of the project among research communities internationally.

###  Turing BinderHub Federation:

-   The Binder Federation ([https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)) is a series of BinderHubs ([https://jupyter.org/binder](https://jupyter.org/binder)) around the world providing free and public computational resources in the cloud to run and share reproducible analyses across all domains of data science. One such BinderHub is supported by the Azure credits provided by the Turing Institute and The Turing Way project.
-   This resource decentralises and democratises access to cutting edge data science and AI methodologies for data scientists, science communication experts, computational science teachers, and many others around the world and empowers them to participate in high quality research. Turing's involvement raises the Institute's reputation as a supporter of open infrastructure, open and reproducible science, and transparent communication of research across domains and technical ability. It demonstrates The Turing Way’s commitment to contributing to open source projects to build flexible and reusable tools, practices and systems. Being a member of this Federation also gives us a seat at the table in discussions around how the future of accessible and explainable AI might look and feeds back skills in managing/deploying large-scale production code and community building into the Turing community.
-   The Turing cluster (turing.mybinder.org) had 461,349 launches in 2020 for more than 3,000 GitHub projects. See [details here](https://notebooks-test.gesis.org/binderlaunches/#?from=2020-01-01T00%3A00&to=2021-01-01T00%3A00&desc=true&origins=turing.mybinder.org&repo=%3A&groupby=provider-repo.). Some noteworthy projects on GitHub that use Binder to teach Python programming and machine learning are ‘ipython/ipython-in-depth’ (205744 launches), ‘jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo’ (141108 launches) and Scikit-learn (2352 launches).
    
### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   Development to the guides on project design and communication have been slower than other guides. We will specifically invite and support contributions to these guides in the next months through workshops and upcoming Book Dash events.

2. In 2021, The Turing Way’s collaboration with the Open Life Science programme, ‘OLS for Turing’, will be supported by the Turing Online Training Grant. Five members from Turing and The Turing Way have joined the Open Life Science third iteration (OLS-3) with five individual projects. These members will graduate in May 2021 along with 30 other international research and community projects in their cohort. This collaboration will help Turing researchers learn about and apply Open Science principles into their work and become a sustained member of The Turing Way.

3. The project has been quoted, cited, and recommended by the researchers, support staff and project leaders in the following posts and online resources from October to December 2020:

### Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

#### Open Source support:

-   The Turing Way is hosted on Netlify ([https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)), which is a serverless platform to build, deploy with CI, and collaborate on web applications. As an Open Source project, Netlify has sponsored the premium account for the project.
-   We aim to set up a web analytics tool for The Turing Way book to capture and evaluate the use and impact of the project. One of our tools of choice, Matomo (a GDPR compliant, open source tool) has also offered a premium account to The Turing Way. Once approved by the IT and Data Protection team, the analytics will be activated and details will be added to the community handbook.

#### In-kind contributions:

-   Camila Rangel Smith, a member of the Turing Research Engineering Group is facilitating Spanish translation of the book by involving Spanish speaking members of the community.
-   TU Delft’s Data Steward (Faculty of Applied Sciences), Esther Plomp, has been contributing to the project development and review process since 2020.
-   Netherlands eScience Center community members Carlos Martinez and Mateusz Kuzak have been offering guidance and support to their Research Software Engineers to develop resources and chapters in The Turing Way as a part of their work since 2020.

## Second Quarter: 1 April 2021 to 31 June 2021. 

### General updates:

#### Project and community statistics: 
-   Book: 47 chapters with 191 subchapters
-   Contributors on GitHub: 279 contributors (starred by 980 users)
-   Twitter: 2,146 followers (average of 2700 profile visits every month)
-   Newsletter: 538 subscribers
-   Slack workspace: 227 members


### Past events:

-   Weekly coworking calls (every Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 GMT) and bi-monthly Collaboration Cafes (first and third Wednesday of each month) took place as planned except in the week of Book Dash in May.
-   Book Dash May 2021 took place from 17 to 21 May 2021. A planning committee was established with 8 members who had attended previous Book Dash events and had sent their applications expressing their interests to mentor new contributors. These members are Arielle Bennett (The Alan Turing Institute), Batool Almarzouq ( King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Saudi Arabia), Brigitta Sipőcz (DIRAC Institute, USA), Carlos Martinez-Ortiz (Netherlands eScience Center), Emma Karoune (The Alan Turing Institute), Esther Plomp (TU Delft) and Laura Carter (University of Exeter). At the event, we hosted 13 development sessions, four open discussion sessions and a show and tell social call. This event was attended by 20 participants who collaborated on 39 Pull Requests (PRs) and 31 issues ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls?q=label%3A0-book-dash-may21+](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls?q=label%3A0-book-dash-may21+)) covering various topics and chapters across the five guides in the book. As a result of collaboration and support provided at this event, 21 new subchapters along with several previously drafted chapters were collaboratively edited, reviewed and published in The Turing Way (listed in a later section).
-   On 21 May 2021, we hosted two community share-outs demonstrating chapter ideas, drafts and illustrations our Book Dash participants generated within four days of the event. You can watch the recordings on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3DlHhbBk3Aa8KzaOEUc8dEic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3DlHhbBk3Aa8KzaOEUc8dEic) .
    

### Upcoming projects:

-   A weekly onboarding call was launched in February. Although suggested by a few members in the community, this call has not been very popular. Therefore we are going to stop hosting this call, and instead launch a series of themed community calls for new community members to engage within the community starting in September.
-   The Turing Way governance plans proposed by Malvika Sharan have been approved by Kirstie Whitaker. In the coming months, a community-led effort to build the governance structure will be supported. The outcome of this project will help establish standards and recommendations for the governance within the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme.

### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   For an online resource with international contributors and users, The Turing Way can benefit from insights gained from basic user activity such as chapters that are more or less visited and geographic locations where The Turing Way is accessed from. It can help us enhance the user experience by providing appropriate resources and improve our reach in communities/countries that we haven’t reached yet. Data for this metric can be acquired by using web analytics services. Several GDPR compliant solutions exist and have been tested on The Turing Way to provide reliable and secure data by ensuring anonymisation and protection of identifiable user data right from the start. Testing was concluded on a trial account offered by Matomo that only collected location information and pages visited by the users. Unfortunately, after several discussions with the data protection team, it was decided that we can not use Matomo’s web analytics as the software doesn’t fully comply with Turing's contractual and governing law policies. At this point, we are not using any web analytics service.

### Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

Two proposals under the ASG Gem funding scheme were granted to the Tools, Practices and Systems and The Turing Way members.
-   A proposal under the ASG Health theme to strengthen the Turing-Crick partnership was successful. It will fund a 0.5 position of a Research Engineering Group member from Turing to collaborate with The Turing Way team members to build training materials under the title “Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical researchers”. This project will build upon “The Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards” ([https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/crick-turing-biomedical-data-science-awards](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/crick-turing-biomedical-data-science-awards)) and will bring together experts from Turing, Open Life Science and The Carpentries training programmes.
- Another proposal is to enhance the user experience and interactive design (UX/UI) of The Turing Way. This proposal will also fund a 0.5 position of a Research Engineering Group member who will collaborate with The Turing Way team and community members to help improve accessibility through design in the project. This work will be hugely important in ensuring the legacy and impact of a critical resource for data science and open research, which is already widely cited across multiple domains and influences research practices within the Turing as well as industry, government, and third-sector organisations, such as The Health Foundation.

## Fourth Quarter: 1 October 2021 to 31 December 2021. 

### General updates:

#### Project and community statistics: 

-   Book: 54 chapters with 260+ live pages
-   Contributors on GitHub: 307 contributors (starred by 1200+ users)
-   Twitter: 2,544 followers
-   Newsletter: 576 subscribers
-   Slack workspace: 307 members
-   Project team: The Turing Way project was formalised with the addition of Arielle Bennett, Aida Mehonic and Emma Karoune to the core team. New community managers Aaron Lacey, Achintya Rao and Vicky Hellon, as well as Research Application Managers Alden Conner and Jennifer Ding were further recruited and onboarded formally as part of their roles in the Turing institute.

#### Past events and updates

-   Weekly coworking calls (every Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 GMT) and bi-monthly Collaboration Cafes (first and third Wednesday of each month) took place as planned until 13 December 2021. They will restarted in the thirdsecond week of January 2022.
-   We hosted two events under the newly launched Fireside Chat series (an informal webinar-like event). The first event featured The Turing Way members, Kirstie Whitaker, Malvika Sharan and Cassandra Gould van Praag (Open Science Community Engagement Coordinator - University of Oxford). [See the event details](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-fireside-chat-tickets-185011543507). The second event featured 5 members from across different Open Science spaces including TU Delft, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the National Institute of Agricultural Technology in Argentina, Quantsight and the University of São Paulo. 40+ members registered to attend both the events and more members expressed interest to receive the recording from the call. We will continue hosting this every second month with different topics related to open science, reproducibility, ethics and collaboration.
-   Two sub-projects for the development of “The Turing-Crick Data Science Training for Biomedical Scientists” and “The Turing Way UX/UI development” were funded by the AI for Science and Government and hosted under the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme in collaboration with The Turing Way. The Turing Way UX/UI was carried out by May Yong, Lydia France and Iain Stanson between October and December, who developed a Python Package to enhance the usability aspect of the project by providing curated views for different reader groups. In addition to delivering their specific goals, these projects will help strengthen collaborations with the REG team and the Crick Institute.
-   Book Dash November 2021 took place from 08 to 12 November 2021 with the support of six members from a planning committee and 16 participants. In addition to coworking on research ideas during 12 development sessions, we also hosted three informal discussion sessions, a “show and tell” meal and two Community Share-out events. A complete report is shared on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2021) along with links to recordings from the Share-outs.

### Upcoming projects:

-   The recruitment process for a new community manager in The Turing Way was concluded in November. The new member is expected to start their role in February 2022. One of the first projects undertaken by them will include the co-development of a governance model for The Turing Way to help the project transition to the next level of maturity.
-   The new team of Community Managers at the Turing Institute will be trained and guided to build explicit connections between their projects with The Turing Way. The process developed to enable this will be shared in The Turing Way to allow other projects and organisations to operationalise their partnerships and collaboration with The Turing Way. All resources will be cross-posted on this public repository hosted under The Alan Turing institute’s GitHub organisation repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building) 

#### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   Some operational activities in The Turing Way have been reduced in the project due to increased responsibility for the project leads to engage internally with the Turing’s research groups, onboard new members to the newly established Community Manager’s team in the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme.

### External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)

1.  As part of The Turing Way core team, three members from collaborating projects and organisations have been onboarded in an in-kind capacity: Carlos Martinez (Netherlands eScience Center), Esther Plomp (Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Delft University of Technology) and Sarah Gibson (2i2c and JupyterHub): [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways\_of\_working.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) 
2.  [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) mentoring and training program’s fifth call for application attracted 6 applications from across the Turing and The Turing Way under the ongoing collaboration OLS for Turing. An application from the Research Engineering team was carried forward from the last round to allow more time for the team working to formalise the ongoing partnership between the Binder and The Turing Way.
3.  Malvika Sharan has joined the Advisory Team of MetaDocencia: [https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/malvikasharan/](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/malvikasharan/).
