## First Quarter: 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2020. 

### Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress

-   We engage with our community members from across the globe and provide them with the support they need to continue working on The Turing Way. Last year, this project brought together 70 researchers who worked on different aspects of reproducibility. With the growing interest in both data science and The Turing Way, the project received additional funding to expand its scope by including topics such as project design, collaboration, communication and ethics. 
-   By March 2020, the number of our [contributor’s community](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) had increased to 125 contributors, who volunteer to edit, review, maintain and create new chapters in the book. Several members also offer technical support in maintaining and enhancing the back-end infrastructure that keeps this project stably hosted online.
-   We hosted the online co-working calls, [Collaboration Cafés](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md), twice every month. 
-   In February 2020, we hosted the third in-person [book dash event](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/book-dash) that brought together 15 international participants to The Alan Turing Institute to discuss and collaboratively work on the different aspect of this project including the previously written chapters.
-   The team members of The Turing Way also delivered [workshops](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops) on basic programming skills by Software Carpentry workshop and specific technical skills on Binder and BinderHub in January 2020.
-   By March 2020, a total of 18 complete chapters and several partial chapters were co-authored by contributors from different institutes and backgrounds. The Turing Way project was [highlighted as a research impact story](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/changing-culture-data-science) on the Turing website.
-   The [illustrations co-developed with the Scriberia artists](https://zenodo.org/record/3695300) during the book dash events have been viewed nearly 1500 times and reused by researchers in their presentations, blogs and other online resources.
-   To informally connect with our members, we launched a dedicated Twitter channel ([@turingway](https://twitter.com/turingway)) in February 2020, that had 500 followers already by the end of March.
    
### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   Two new sections of this project in the areas of research ethics and project design haven’t received many contributions. These are specialised skills that will need mentored contributions and reviews by the experts in the field for which we will reach out to the specific members in The Alan Turing Institute.
-   PI Kirstie Whitaker has been working on a Turing COVID19 project which has reduced her availability in the project.

### External engagement, influence, impact

-   We established collaboration with other communities and institutes. Notably, [The Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) joined in to co-develop resources in The Turing Way that can be reused by their community members.
-   The project has been quoted in a blog post by [The Health Foundation](https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-open-health-analytics-our-guide-to-sharing-code-safely-on-github-5d1e018897cb) on how they are using The Turing Way to improve their internal reproducibility and analytics workstreams, which was reposted to [NHSR community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/towards-open-health-analytics-our-guide-to-sharing-code-safely-on-github/).
-   Over the last quarter, The Turing Way has been used and recommended by researchers in their network for its accessibility and collaborative nature. Specifically, during the COVID-19 induced lockdown, members have come together to develop best practices and recommendations on remote working and collaborations.

## Second Quarter: 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. 

### Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress

-   Between April and June, we gained 43 new contributors, increasing the number of our [contributor’s community](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) to 168 members. Many of these contributors engaged with the project through its project repository, the online Collaboration Cafes, coworking calls, training workshops, and by word of mouth through social media.    
-   With the support of the core contributors, the Jupyter Book was upgraded to the latest version, the dedicated locations for the 4 new guides on project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics (in addition to the guide for reproducible research) were launched, and the project’s style guide and contribution guidelines were updated accordingly to facilitate the development of new chapters.
-   As of June 2020, a total of 22 chapters with 81 subchapters were published online across the 5 guides, which were co-authored by contributors from different institutes and research backgrounds primarily through online collaboration. Many contributions to the GitHub repository are open for review, which allows new members to engage with the project in a collaborative manner.
-   We hosted 6 [Collaboration Cafés](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md) in the last 3 months and additionally hosted 1-hr long co-working calls multiple times every week to create opportunities for the project contributors to work on The Turing Way in real-time with the team members.
-   The team members of The Turing Way also delivered 3 [conference and event talks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/conferences), 2 panels, and 1 [training workshops](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops) on technical skills, open science, collaborative research, and reproducibility (listed below).
-   Our Twitter channel ([@turingway](https://twitter.com/turingway)) that was launched in February 2020, had around 800 followers by June 2020.

### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   Since many contributors have been working from home due to the lockdown, the evening sessions of Collaboration Cafes, which were hosted from 19:00-21:00 BST on the third Wednesdays, were not well attended in May and June. This motivated us to schedule both the Collaboration Cafes at 15:00 going forward.

## Fourth Quarter: 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020. 

### Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress

-   Our [community](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) has grown more than three times in size compared to what we started with in January 2020. By December 2020, we had over 250 GitHub contributors and 500 newsletter subscribers and 1500 Twitter followers. 
-   In The Turing Way, we currently have 30 chapters, 134 subchapters and several supporting resources within our five guides and a community handbook.
-   We consistently hosted [Collaboration Cafés](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md) twice every month and 1-hr long coworking calls multiple times every week to create opportunities for the project contributors to work on The Turing Way in real-time with the team members.
-   We hosted a week-long Book Dash event with 20 participants to work on different aspects of the project collaboratively. This was hosted in parallel to the BioHackathon-EU 2020 where The Turing Way was selected as one of the hacking projects.
-   The community members of The Turing Way delivered 7 conference talks/seminars on technical skills, open science, collaborative research, and reproducibility. We also delivered a digital poster and materials for a training workshop on Jupyter Book with the help and support of our core contributors. In addition, we also hosted a day-long sprint at JupyterCon 2020 conference (details listed in the later section).
    
### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   Pandemic was definitely a blocker as in-person collaboration and engagements were not possible. Nevertheless, we as a project and a community could adapt our work as needed for all remote collaboration and attract engagement from the global audience in the project.

### External engagement, influence, impact

-   We successfully hosted a technical writer, Paul Owoicho, from September to December 2020 as a part of [Google Season of Doc](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) 2020 involvement. Paul provided editorial support in the project that aimed at ensuring that the contribution pathways in The Turing Way are accessible, contributors have sufficient support, guidance and templates to participate in the project and maintain consistency in the book as it grows. A full report from his involvement can be [read online](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/communications/GSOD-applications/GSoD-2020-Project-Report.md).
-   The Turing Way participated in [HacktoberFest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) that allowed new contributors to receive support and mentorship they need to engage with Open Source projects like The Turing Way. Existing community members had the opportunity to share their experience with new contributors by reviewing and supporting their contributions.
-   Since 2019, we have developed useful illustrations collaboratively with The Turing Way Book Dash participants using the scribing service of Scriberia. These have been shared for community use on Zenodo and have been downloaded nearly 4000 times to use in different Open Source materials. A new set of illustrations was released in December 2020 that can be reused under CC-BY 4.0 license with the appropriate citation: “This image was created by Scriberia for The Turing Way community and is used under a CC-BY licence. Zenodo. [](https://zenodo.org/record/4323154) [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4323154](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4323154)”.
-   The Turing Way’s collaboration with Open Life Science ([OLS-2 for Turing](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators)) attracted 12 members from across 6 projects in the Turing and The Turing Way community, who successfully graduated from the program in December 2020. Particularly, a project was led by three members, Ismael Kherroubi Garcia, Laura Carter and Sophia Batchelor who worked on developing The Turing Way’s Guide for Ethical Research. Another project by Paul Owoicho and Neha Moopen focused on enhancing the accessibility aspect of The Turing Way.

### Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

[The Turing Online Training grant](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-09/online_training_call_-_guidelines.pdf) was jointly awarded to Open Life Science and The Turing Way to support their collaboration “OLS for Turing”. This opportunity will allow us to involve the Turing members in getting trained and mentored in Open Science. This will particularly allow us to share open research principles into the ongoing projects in Turing.
