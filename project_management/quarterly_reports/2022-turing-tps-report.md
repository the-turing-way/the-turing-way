## Overview of the project

**Overview of the project:** _The Turing Way_ is an open source and community-led project that aims to make data science comprehensible and useful for everyone. This project brings together its diverse community of researchers, educators, learners, administrators and stakeholders from within The Alan Turing Institute and beyond. _The Turing Way_ provides a web-based book with five guides on reproducible research, project design, communication, collaboration and ethical research, as well as a community handbook.

The project is available online on GitHub ([https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)) under the CC-BY license owned by _The Turing Way_ community. The project uses Jupyter Book ([https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book)) to host its content online at [https://book.the-turing-way.org](https://book.the-turing-way.org/).

## First Quarter: 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022.

### General updates:

#### Project and community statistics

* Book: 55 chapters with 250+ live pages
* Contributors on GitHub: 325 contributors (starred by 1300+ users)
* Twitter: 2,789 followers
* Newsletter: 593 subscribers
* Slack workspace: 374 members
* Project team: The Turing Way core team now hosts 18 members including the Turing Community Managers, Research Application Managers, Programme Manager and volunteer contributors. Four members from the community were also formally recognised as the Translation and Localisation Leads, and included in the project team document.

#### Past events and updates

* The new Community Manager of The Turing Way, Anne Lee Steele joined the project in March 2022. 
* Weekly coworking calls (every Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 GMT) and bi-monthly Collaboration Cafes (first and third Wednesday of each month) took place as planned with an exception for the Bank Holidays.
* We hosted two Fireside Chat series in February and March 2022. The February’s Fireside chat was co-organised with the Talarify Founder and Director, Anelda van der Walt, on the topic “Gaps & Opportunities for Inclusive, Multilingual Data Science”. The event speakers included Batool Almarzouq (Saudi Arabia), Bobby Shabangu (South Africa), Camila Rangel-Smith (the Turing, UK), David Pérez-Suárez (UCL, UK) and Yanina Bellini Saibene (Argentina). The March’s event was co-organised with the Open Post Academics (OPA) programme, on the topic “Emergent Roles in Research Infrastructure & Technology". Chaired by Beth Duckles (OPA, USA) and Arielle Bennett (the Turing, UK), this panel will feature insights from Noor Shaker (Glamorous AI, UK), Esther Plomp (TU Delft, Netherlands) and Borhane (Bo) Blili-Hamelin (OPA, USA). Each event had an average of 65 registrations, with community members coming from international universities, organisations and funding groups.
* [The Turing-Crick Data Science Training for Biomedical Scientists](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience), funded from October 2021, or March 2022 by the AI for Science and Government was hosted under the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme. The programme funding allowed to buy out 0.5 FTE of one Data Scientist, Lydia France, who was involved in the development of the first drafts of the two training modules in The Carpentries incubator shared under the CC-BY 4.0 License. Led by Malvika Sharan, Lydia France, senior data scientists, Federico Nanni and the Health theme lead, Alisha Davies, designed and carried out feedback interviews with several senior researchers and fellows from the Cricka and Turing institutes. Since the project requires further review and development, a review and illustration sprint has been planned on 28 and 29 April (with a webinar of 11 April), that will be attended by 15 international researchers who would like to use the training materials in their own organisations.
* The next Book Turing Way Dash event is planned to take place from 16 to 20 May 2022. The Book Dash committee will be joined by 8 returning participants and core team members, who will help run the call for application, review and select the participants, and host the different sessions during the event. Two community-share out has been planned on 20 May to allow participants outside the Book Dash to get an overview of the project after the Book Dash.

#### Upcoming projects

* Two new community managers joining the AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Research Support Facility (AIM RSF) will join the team of Community Managers, as well as the project team of The Turing Way. Learning from other community managers will help establish cross-project collaboration while ensuring the adoption of the best practices from The Turing Way at the Turing and beyond. Like all Research Application Managers (RAM), the new RAM for the Data Safe Haven will also be onboarded in The Turing Way project team.
* The Turing Skills team members are collaborating with Malvika Sharan to develop two programmes, AI and Data Science and Educators Programme and TPS Peer Mentoring Programmes. Call for applications for both have been launched.
* We have submitted a project proposal for the Google Season of Code (GSoC) to invite candidates (student developers and coders) to work on The Turing Way for three months. With our project plan, we are interested in improving and integrating a Python package developed for The Turing Way to enhance the usability of our book. Project ideas are shared on the GitHub issue and Neurostars.

The full report is [available here](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2022).

#### Upcoming projects

* The **eighth Book Dash** is set to take place from 14-18 November. With Book Dash committee members from both the Turing and the international volunteer members, we are planning to support a local hub in London and Amsterdam. **Two community-share-out events** are planned on 18 November to invite participants outside the Book Dash to get an overview of what everyone worked on during the Book Dash including a public event updating the community on the progress made in the project’s governance process.
* The next quarterly Turing Way core team meeting is planned for early December. The team will update the volunteer and staff members of the core team regarding the recent progress in the projects, and invite votes on next plans for the first quarter of 2023.
* Another programme in collaboration with the skills team, **TPS peer-mentoring**, will be developed, drawing materials from The Turing Way. This project will follow the procedure and processes established for the AI and Data Science Educators programme.
* Previous funding from the Turing online training grant was awarded by the Skills team in 2021 to The Turing Way and Open Life Science has enabled the delivery of two cohorts of Open Life Science. One of the deliverables is **online training in open science** that is being developed in collaboration with the Open Life Science team to be hosted in the Turing online training platform.

### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

* Monthly newsletter releases as a mode of reporting have not been regular due to other engagements of the community manager, which include the formalisation of the various working groups in the community and organising Fireside Chats. We have also noticed that there is a need to delegate and spread out The Turing Way Team's responsibilities among other members of the core team, especially the Turing staff in the TPS (CMs and RAMs). The newly funded project and position will allow us to reorient the roles and responsibilities of the community manager and delegate some tasks to other members, allowing important community management tasks to stay on time.

### External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)

* In response to the adoption of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science in November 2021, UNESCO launched a Global Call for Best Practices in Open Science in November 2021. This year, The Turing Way (TTW), Open Life Science (OLS), and Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) communities collaborated to organise three calls to develop community-led responses to the UNESCO call. The Turing Way response, titled ‘Broadening the definition and implementation of accessibility, inclusion and incentivisation in open science' was recently published on Zenodo. Thanks goes to Esther Plomp, Emmy Tsang, Arielle Bennett, Patricia Heterich, Alina Popescu, Eirini Zormpa, Emma Karoune, Vicky Hellon, Alejandro Coca-Castro, Batool Almarzouq, Anne Lee Steele, and Malvika Sharan who developed The Turing Way response. Thank you for thoughtful considerations on open science, and for joining us in this opportunity to combine our perspectives. Other two reports from OLS: https://zenodo.org/record/6841873 and IOI: https://zenodo.org/record/6828389.
* Malvika Sharan was selected to sit on the Community Panel for the agency’s $40 million, five-year mission, Transform to Open Science (TOPS), which aims to get NASA scientists learning about and applying principles of open science. Another project of NASA-TOPS called OpenCore, involves 35 experts from the global research community, 15 of which engage with The Turing Way, and are drawing information to build open access training materials under this initiative. In October, Malvika will join the NASA-TOPS team with the other 9 Community Panellists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in LA for a public panel discussion and future planning, strengthening the connections between the projects.
* Malvika was also invited to sit on the steering committee for Notebooks Now!, a project funded by the Sloan foundation under the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

### Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

* The Turing Way proposal to the **Ecosystem Leadership Bid was awarded**. The funding approved for Financial Year 2022-23 is £122,003. The funding underwritten for the financial year 2023-24 is £362,074, and 2024-onwards is £560,449. This funding will support the project ‘The Turing Way Practitioner Hub: Extending the adoption of reproducible, ethical and collaborative practices in data science and AI’, which includes funding for a short-term technical writer position and long-term PDRA position.

### Awards/recognition

* The Turing Way was recently added to the Civic Tech Field Guide, a crowdsourced collection of thousands of tech for good projects from around the world. 
* The Turing Way was also selected to Mozilla’s Building Trustworthy AI Working Group, represented by Anne Lee Steele and Jennifer Ding.
* The Turing Way was nominated for the Royal Society Athena Prize, which although unsuccessful, received extremely positive feedback from the award panellists “The panel felt that this was a particularly strong nomination, a fantastic combination of ethical science and inclusivity. They specifically liked that there was great evidence of it being used and adapted. The panel felt that this project is a good example of best practice, and is highly transferable with it already being picked up in the biology and ecology fields. The panel also noted that the project is extremely innovative and has great longevity.” The panel strongly recommends submitting a nomination when the award opens again in November 2023 with more detail in the nomination about who specifically is impacted by this project and how it can impact people who don’t use code.
* The Turing Way is shortlisted for the OpenUK 2022 award under the belonging category - announcement for the winners will be made in November.

## Fourth Quarter: 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2022.

* Project team: The Turing Way core team now hosts 31 members including the Turing staff members from TPS (Senior Researchers, Community Managers, Research Application Managers, Research Project Manager, and Programme Manager), as well as volunteer members leading various sub-projects within the community. 
* Since the TPS researchers are included as core staff members of the project, we have defined pathways for them to get involved which are shared via The Turing Way onboarding materials. More recently, these onboarding materials are customised for each person’s role in the project, for instance, refer to this document created to onboard the Senior Community Manager, Gabin Kayumbi. 
* A core team meeting was held in December 2022. Hosted by the Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele, members of the core organising team came together to share updates with each other. As a part of the project's governance, representatives of infrastructure maintenance, writers & reviewers, Mentors & Trainers and Translation & Localisation working groups shared updates from their areas of work. The members of different working groups are addressing issues crucial to the sustainability of the project while formalising their ways of working and identifying what ongoing support could look like for them. Each working group currently operates independently of other groups, while reporting their progress during the coworking calls on Monday. 
	* Four volunteer team members, Jim Madge, Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside and Brigitta Sipocz have started an Infrastructure Working Group to improve the process of reviewing, updating, and maintaining the technical infrastructure of the project. Supported by the project team, they have started meeting monthly every second Thursday of the month. 
	* Four volunteer members from the community, Batool Alamrzouq, Camilla Rangel Smith, Alejandro Coca and Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, continue to lead the Translation and Localisation efforts with a much larger group of contributors co-leading and driving the translation of The Turing Way into Spanish, and Arabic, French, Japanese, Turkish, Mandarin, and Portuguese.
	* Two volunteer members: Andrea Sanchez-Tapía and Liz Hare have been invited by the team to design a chapter on accessibility drawing from their work and recently published a paper from the UseR conference. This is part of a border discussion on likely scoping a guide discussing accessibility practices in data science. This discussion started during the November 2022 edition of the Book Dash and will be picked up again in May 2023 Book Dash.
	* Two TPS staff member-led Working Groups started in late 2022 under the topics “Trainers and Mentors” and “Reviewers and Editors” to provide auditing and review the future support for community contributors to the book and community activities.

#### Past events and updates
* Weekly coworking calls (every Monday, 11:00 - 12:00 GMT) and bi-monthly Collaboration Cafes (the first and third Wednesday of each month) took place as planned with an exception for the Bank Holidays. 
* The final Fireside Chat of 2022 took place in October under the topic “Supporting Citizen Participatory Science Communities”, which was attended by ~35 people. 62 signed up for tickets. 
* An overview of the Fireside Chat Series from 2021-2022:
	* We had 609 registered across all Fireside Chats during the inaugural 2021-2022 season, not including the 46 organisers and speakers across 43 organisations. 406 of these members attended at least two fireside chats.
* The eighth Book Dash took place from 14-18 November. The Book Dash committee members from both the Turing and the international volunteer members supported local hubs in London and Amsterdam. The event involved 19 international members. Working across 32 Issues and 33 Pull Requests on GitHub, our participants updated and published 5 existing and 6 new chapters/subchapters. Check out the following new chapters published in The Turing Way book: Data Wrangler subchapter in the Research Infrastructure chapter, Research Ethics for Social Data, Data Curation, Declarative Virtual Machines with Vagrant in the Virtual Environment chapter, Research Objects in Action and Peer Review subchapters. In addition, all participants contributed to co-developing 14 new illustrations released on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807. The full report is available here: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2022
* As a part of Book Dash, Sophia Batchelor and Hari Sood delivered a **Github Training Session** that was attended by 15 participants including staff from the Alan Turing Institute and the wider Turing Way community. 
* **Two community-share-out events** were hosted on 18 November to invite participants outside the Book Dash to get an overview of what everyone worked on during the Book Dash including a public event updating the community on the progress made in the project’s governance process.
* The quarterly **Core Team meeting** occurred on 9 December 2022, which was attended by 8 TPS core staff and 4 Volunteer members, each of whom shared updates from the working groups they lead and participate in. The Core Team was introduced to the plans for The Turing Way Practitioners Hub. The next meeting will take place in the first quarter of 2023.

#### Upcoming projects
* The Turing Way Research Project Manager will join the team in February 2023 and the Practitioners Hub will commence in 2023
* Asynchronous reporting methods are being developed for The Turing Way Core team to account for an expanding staff team with allocated time to work on the project and for consistent project updates between full quarterly team meetings
* Following the full community review in 2022, The Turing Way event schedule for community activities has been centralised for the community to identify different events, build a thematic communications strategy and connect when attending an in-person event.

### Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

* Governance work in the project continues to be developed, intending to ensure transparent decision-making and consistent reporting for the expanding staff and volunteer community members. These processes have not yet been recorded in the community handbook - blockers are time limitations for the small team of Turing Way members, as well as the necessity to continue to support emergent events and gatherings for distributed global teams.
