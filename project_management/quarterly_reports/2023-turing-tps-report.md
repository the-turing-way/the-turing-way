### The Turing Way Core Team

* Supported by the core delivery team (Kirstie Whitaker, Malvika Sharan, Anne Lee Steele and Alexandra Araujo Alvarez), the Core Team now hosts 31 members that include volunteer members leading various sub-projects and Working Groups (WG) within the community as well as Turing staff members from TPS (Senior Researchers, Community Managers, Research Application Managers, Research Project Manager, and Programme Manager). We onboarded the full-time project manager, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez in the team in February 2023.
### Volunteer-based community groups:
* The Turing Way core team now hosts 31 members including the Turing staff members from TPS (Senior Researchers, Community Managers, Research Application Managers, Research Project Manager, and Programme Manager), as well as volunteer members leading various sub-projects within the community.
	* Eight new members joined and four members stepped down.
    	* Liz Hare (co-lead of the Accessibility WG) and Melissa Black (co-lead of the Translation and Localisation team) join as volunteer members
    	* Alejandro Coca-Castro stepped down as co-lead from the Translation and Localisation team, but will continue to participate in the Core Team to represent the Environmental Data Science book.
    	* We also offboarded Camila Rangel-Smith as a previous volunteer lead of the Translation and Localisation team, and Cami Rincon, Eirini Zormpa and Arron Lacey, as previous members of the TPS programme.

### Formalising Project's Governance


* The core team meeting in March 2023 was hosted by the Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele. Members of the core organising team came together to share updates. As a part of the project's governance, representatives of infrastructure maintenance, writers & reviewers, Mentors & Trainers and Translation & Localisation working groups shared updates from their areas of work. The members of different working groups are addressing issues crucial to the sustainability of the project while formalising their ways of working and identifying what ongoing support could look like for them. Each working group currently operates independently of other groups, while reporting their progress during the coworking calls on Monday.
    * Four volunteer team members, Jim Madge, Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside and Brigitta Sipocz have started an Infrastructure Working Group to improve the process of reviewing, updating, and maintaining the technical infrastructure of the project. Supported by the project team, they have started meeting monthly every second Thursday of the month.
    * Three volunteer members from the community, Batool Alamrzouq, Melissa Black and Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, continue to lead the Translation and Localisation efforts with a much larger group of contributors co-leading and driving the translation of _The Turing Way _into Spanish, and Arabic, French, Japanese, Turkish, Mandarin, and Portuguese.
    * Two volunteer members: Andrea Sanchez-Tapía and Liz Hare have been invited by the team to design a chapter on accessibility drawing from their work and recently published a paper from the UseR conference. This is part of a border discussion on likely scoping a guide discussing accessibility practices in data science. This discussion started during the November 2022 edition of the Book Dash and was picked up again in the May 2023 Book Dash.
	* Since June, Core Team meetings, fortnightly Core Delivery Team meetings and weekly Coworking calls have been convened to facilitate discussion and an action-based approach to governance work. The project-delivery meetings have become a place to share regular updates from the project, set priorities for resource allocation and create accountability among the core delivery team (staff members from the Turing).
	* Following June's Core Team meeting, a number of questions were collected across different areas of work that can improve transparency about how different decisions can be increasingly made transparently. Different areas of work were identified to be taken forward by different groups within the community as well as the core delivery team.
	* Anne had spent last year identifying different subprojects and supporting the formalisation of different working groups in the community. Drawing learnings from the Translation and Localisation team, she formalised the Infrastructure and Accessibility Working Groups. She has created documents to guide the creation, operation and governance of working groups, and provide clarification on their decision-making making process in the context of The Turing Way project governance. The draft has been approved to be shared on GitHub by the core delivery team to gather feedback from the Core Team and the broader community.
	* Kirstie has drafted a document to clarify the role of the Turing Institute in The Turing Way, a document to be shared on GitHub for open review and feedback. This document is written for the broader community to identify how the project has been supported sustainably since 2019 through investment from the institute, which has been funding the positions of core delivery team members and the other costs to support the community infrastructure.
	* The discussion has also led to the plans for evolving the Core Team to form a community-led Steering Committee joined by the chairs and leads of subprojects and Working Groups from the community. This evolution would also formalise the role of the Turing members from the TPS programme, who will have the opportunity to provide secretariat support in the different aspects of the project.
	* During September's Core Team meeting, a three-level organisation structure was shared - a work drafted and enabled by Alexandra with recommendations from the core delivery team and Bastian Greshake-Tzovaras. [A collaborative Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/) was used for the Core Team to raise questions and share feedback. Since the core delivery team did not have clear recommendations and actionable feedback, they will meet different members individually or in groups to collect data on what the Core Team would like to see their role in that governance structure.


### Highlights from the community	

* We have defined pathways for TPS team members to get involved in The Turing Way activities, which are shared via [The  Turing Way onboarding materials](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/ttw-core-team-onboarding). More recently, these onboarding materials have been customised for each person’s role in the project.
* The Turing Way project has transitioned from a single GitHub repository to a dedicated organisation to allow a more flexible community-led infrastructure where different repositories can be created and maintained by community members to support their work. The Translation and Localisation team has been maintaining a separate organisation to allow different language groups to work on separate repositories, which showed the community's need for an independent GitHub organisation for the project. This transition will also allow the separation of different kinds of resources, such as project management, working groups and governance documentation, making them FAIR.
	* The next Book Dash is planned from 13-17 November. A new Book Dash Working Group has been formed that has enabled strategic planning. Core team members Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune and Esther Plomp have taken on the chair roles with operational support from Alexandra and Anne. Alexandra will remain responsible for budget and in-person logistics, while the delivery of the event will be overseen by Anne.
	* Fireside Chats events took place in May, June and September organised by project members Anne Lee Steele, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez and Malvika Sharan. Co-hosts for these events represented the NASA-TOPS, Environmental Data Science Book and eScience Center Netherlands. The most recent Fireside Chat was featured under the Open Source Initiative's Deep Dive in Open Source AI. We share details and resources created later in this report.
	* SSI fellows for the year 2023 include UK Fellows: Georgia Aitkenhead (AutSPACEs researcher) and previous Turing Way contributor; Aman Goel, Saranjeet Kaur and Stephen Klusza and the first cohort of OLS-SSI fellows (hosted by Open Life Science - OLS): Andrea Sanchez Tapia, Raina Camacho Toro and Melissa Black. Andrea is a co-lead of The Turing Way localisation team and continues this work as a fellow while closely collaborating with Melissa (also a member of Spanish localisation work), who will lead the 'EspañOLS' localisation work in OLS.
	* Many participatory projects at the Turing are leading the way for responsible research and innovation in data science. The Turing Way community have always exemplified that, which is highlighted in the 'AI for Science and Government' impact report [Better Together: The people-centred approaches driving forward data ethics](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/impact-stories/better-together-people-centred-approaches-driving-forward-data-ethics). The report discusses the various avenues where The Turing Way has played a key role. We thank Laura Ación, Chelle Gentemann and Chris Erdmann for their contributions to this article highlighting how they champion The Turing Way in their organisations.

### The Turing Way Practitioners Hub

* Funded under the Turing’s Ecosystem Leadership Award, and co-funded by the BridgeAI project, we recruited a Research Project Manager for The Turing Way, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, who has started work on the project since February 2023. In her initial months, she will be primarily ramping up the Practitioners Hub project planning, documentation and establishing partnerships for the first cohort of the Practitioners Hub, planned to start in June 2023. Each cohort will last for 6 months and each organisation will involve a representative as an Expert in Residence, working the Turing Way in 0.2 FTE paid capacity. Find details shared with the partnering organisations in this [priming document](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1n4n7-5FhAuf5fAOZ5VB8h1VbyZBHwzx6gZw6jzrq87Y/edit#heading=h.qqcosfgcdlg5).
* The recruitment for the Senior Research Associate took place in April - however, this round of recruitment was unsuccessful. The Turing Way leads will revise the job description to open the recruitment again, clarifying the role of this position holder to lead the Practitioners Hub activities involving interview-based research, process development and open source consultation and support.
* The Practitioners Hub’s first cohort is in progress with five Experts in Residence (EiRs) from British Antarctic Survey, Genomics England, Digihaul, Energy Systems Catapult and Office of National Statistics. Details can be found on the project website: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub). After onboarding on 27<sup>th</sup> June for the Experts in Residence (EiRs), an in-person launch event was organised 27 July 2023 with the EiRs, BridgeAI contributors and the selected members from the data science ecosystem. The workshop featured a Skills panel featuring the BridgeAI skills working group, represented by Vera Matser (The Alan Turing Institute) and Nia Alexandrov (Hartree). 
* A keynote panel was hosted on the theme “adopting data science best practices” with internal and external speakers: Neil Chue Hong (Director of Software Sustainability Institute), Lauren Wool (Great London Authority), Simon Reeve (The Alan Turing Institute / Lloyd’s Register Foundation) and Kirstie Whitaker (The Alan Turing Institute). The panel was moderated by Jennifer Ding (The Alan Turing Institute) and the[ video was shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTH6-BA9ouE&t=2s) on The Turing Way YouTube channel.
* The Practitioners Hub organised knowledge exchange and training activities as well as working on the co-creation of case studies. The EiRs received training on the following topics delivered by the project lead Malvika, as well as by external experts: stakeholder and mapping engagement (Malvika), User Journey Mapping and individual coaching sessions (Fruto consulting company), Open Leadership Practices (Malvika), Pedagogy of technical teaching (Malvika) and Skills and knowledge Gap Analysis (Vera Matser, Head of Skills and Sarah Nietopski, Skills Officers).
* Drafts of Expert’s case studies were produced, each covering the opportunities, barriers and recommendations around open-source practices and supplying successful examples for others adopting best practices from The Turing Way. Vicky Hellon, Arielle Bennett and Lucy Killaron (Enrichment students) successfully liaised between the organisation and hub in the case study development. A Case Study Development Framework has been produced to support the development of the case studies under the Practitioners Hub. The first version is shared on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 Licence:[ https://zenodo.org/records/10000713](https://zenodo.org/records/10000713). A review will be conducted in 2024 to make them reusable across the BridgeAI projects.
* A workshop with Genomics England was hosted to connect a citizen science project from the Diverse Data team (led by Maxine Mackintosh) with TPS researchers and the Turing programme more broadly. Alex has been instrumental in coordinating and delivering this meeting with Raphael, which was also attended by the partnership team. This meeting has resulted in a potential shared recruitment of staff members proposed by the Diverse Data team, a request for which is with Kirstie.

### Past events and updates

* The **ninth Book Dash** took place from 22-26 May 2023. The Book Dash committee members from both the Turing and the international volunteer members supported local hubs in London, Delft hub and online. The event involved 37 international members. Working across 28 Issues and 35 Pull Requests on GitHub, our participants updated and published 5 existing and 3 new chapters/subchapters. Check out the following new chapters published in The Turing Way book: 3 subchapters. In addition, all participants contributed to co-developing 29 new illustrations released on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.  The full report is [available here](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-may2023).
* The **tenth Book Dash** took place from 13-17 Nov 2023. The Book Dash committee members from both the Turing and the international volunteer members supported the local hub in London and online participants. The event involved 32 international members. Working across 34 Issues and 42 Pull Requests on GitHub, our participants updated and published five existing and six new chapters/subchapters. Check out the following new chapters published in The Turing Way book: 3 subchapters. The full report is [available here](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/book-dash/2023-Nov-BookDash-10.md).
* [Asynchronous reporting methods](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RQhAHM7PcOAYKPOKfBGyVV_R4bRHca5jVVY3mQC2Ry0/edit) are being developed for The Turing Way Core team to account for an expanding staff team with allocated time to work on the project and for consistent project updates between full quarterly team meetings
* Following the full [community review in 2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e_blaqxjjzUAAbhX1y_cNIN9OVj980j3RYR_n5xRt9g/edit#gid=207621103), The Turing Way event schedule for community activities has been [centralised](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-VZvmFL4PnSBsv_G9ZD3dwjIYLno3NyL7oHvbplnWs/edit) for the community to identify different events, build a thematic communications strategy and connect when attending an in-person event.

## Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

* The Turing Way Website plan was paused as we did not find the Turing website or microsite as an appropriate solution for the project. Ideally, the website content should be hosted on GitHub with community members being able to propose updates. [The Turing Way Practitioners Hub website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub) was time-sensitive, for which we have gone ahead with Turing’s microsite option, which also strategically fits better as a BridgeAI-funded project.
* The Turing Way website design has started and we expect its launch prior to The Practitioners Hub 1st Cohort Launch in June. Contra has been identified as the supplier in charge and The Turing Comm’s team is suggesting some changes. It has been three months without any concrete outcome from the communications team, delaying the process of communication required in the project.
* Governance work in the project continues to be developed, intending to ensure transparent decision-making and consistent reporting for the expanding staff and volunteer community members. These processes have not yet been recorded in the community handbook - blockers are time limitations for the small team of Turing Way members, as well as the necessity to continue to support emergent events and gatherings for distributed global teams.

### External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)

* Malvika attended the in-person event hosted by the **NASA-TOPS** team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California for the community panel. The meeting was live streamed openly - a report for which is published on Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7464443](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7464443). NASA-TOPS have since published their [website](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) & [Jupyter Book](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/index.html). This resource highlights The Turing Way as one of its key resources: [https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/reading_list.html?highlight=turing%20way](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/reading_list.html?highlight=turing%20way). The NASA-TOPS team has worked with the White House Office of Science and Technology to announce the year of open science, jointly declared by 12 Federal organisations: [https://open.science.gov/](https://open.science.gov/).  
* The Turing Way was listed as a community project by the **Incentivising Collaborative and Open Research (ICOR)** project, under the Evidences and Best Practices section: [https://incentivizingopen.org/solutions/evidence-best-practices/](https://incentivizingopen.org/solutions/evidence-best-practices/).
* Malvika Sharan and Arielle Bennett held a scoping workshop with 2i2c Executive Director Chris Holdgraf to identify overlaps and shared projects where we can explore ongoing and future collaboration via TPS and The Turing Way.
	* An ongoing CZI-funded project, that aims to build capacity in Latin America, has the potential to integrate The Turing Way materials in their work via the ongoing localisation effort.
	* Sarah Gibson, who is leading the JupyterHub’s Community Development efforts, has already been working in The Turing Way for several years and is collaborating closely with Malvika and Anne to exchange resources and practices from the project to bring back into the JupyterHub's work. One of the goals is to adopt The Turing Way Community handbook for their community by making these resources ‘Forkable’.
* Similar workshops were held with the **OpenUK** CEO Amanda Brock, which was hosted by Hari Sood - RAM, and attended by Kirstie, Malvika, Arielle and Shane Conneely (partnership development officer). Shane has shared the following future direction for this collaboration:
	* Policy board position and request for Kirstie to speak at an OpenUl event. Amanda shared her interest in doing a joint talk and/or workshop.
	* Malvika will be giving a talk at the State of Open Con in February. Amanda suggested that the TPS team also hold an information booth.
	* Research – Around the specific piece of work evaluating the value of openness to the economy, on further reflection, this is probably not strictly within the wheelhouse of Turing researchers however we would be happy to be kept abreast of plans for this development. In terms of research more generally we are currently evaluating our priorities for the year ahead and will have more clarity on this in the months ahead.
	* Creating links to other Turing projects, such as AI Standard Hub.
* Malvika hosted a workshop with the MetaDocencia (Argentina) team at The Alan Turing Institute during their London visit in January. They identified the following areas for collaboration in 2023:
	* Localisation work where Melissa Black, one of the MetaDocencia staff is already involved, has been awarded an OLS-SSI fellowship to support that work with another community member Andrea Sanchez-Tapia (Localisation co-lead and an OLS-SSI fellow).
	* Seminar or speaking opportunities for Laura Acion during one of her future visits planned in 2023
	* Malvika will continue in her membership to their Advisory committee and will be attending an Advisory meeting in April during her visit to Buenos Aires.
	* They would explore future opportunities to co-author reports and publications based on their collaborations.
* Malvika also hosted Flavio Azevedo, founder of the **FORRT project** to learn about each other’s projects and where FORRT resources can be plugged into The Turing Way.
* A meeting with the UNESCO Open Science Working Group took place in May 2023, following which a member of their team contributed to the Fireside Chat. They have indexed The Turing Way in their resources and are interested in written pieces. Will schedule a follow-up in September.
* The NASA TOPS Panel with Malvika in an advisory role took place online from 14 to 16 June attended by an average of 100 people each day. A report from the event will be published on Zenodo.
* Malvika was invited to attend a CZI workshop in Buenos Aires Argentina under the theme Open Science in Latin America. She represented the Turing and The Turing Way and led a workshop on the need for an Open Science Localisation Hub with two co-leads of the Translation and Localisation team, Melissa Black and Andrea Tapia Sanchez. The attendees included several Turing Way members, as well as leaders from other communities, including Translate Science, Open Source Hardware, MetaDocencia, Open Science Saud Arabia, Outreachy, R-OpenSci and more.
* A meeting with Josh Gottesmann, Senior Associate Director, Data Resources, from the Michael J. Fox Foundation took place on Community of Practice. They are interested in collaborating in The Turing Way Practitioners Hub and Community Management activities. Currently, they are piloting a Community of Practice and would like to follow up in October when they go public with it.
* A workshop for funders was also co-facilitated with folks from eScience Center, ScilifeLab, NWO, and PLOS on Software Citation. The Turing Way was presented as a Digital Common to start centralising recommendations for different stakeholders, and a new feature developed last year by the RSE team and improved this year by a GSOC intern was appreciated as a good way to curate resources for different collaborating group:[ https://zenodo.org/record/8353824](https://zenodo.org/record/8353824). There are future interests from SustainOSS and ReSA to facilitate this work through workshops. CZI has offered to support this work through funding, a 1-page plan and a budget which will be developed by the stakeholders involved.
* Emma is a committee member of HiddenRef festival, an event which took place on 21 Sep in Bristol in person with over 100 people. Emma and Cass delivered a workshop designed under the Skills Policy Awards.
* Malvika is on the CS&S Event Fund Advisory panel, which was paused for a year, but they have received funding to support RSEs in African research communities in the next round. They will look for some insights from the Turing and UK RSE communities.

## Funding: Further funding, leveraged funding/support, in-kind contributions

* **Skills Policy Award** (by the Alan Turing Institute’s Skills team) was awarded to Emma Karoune in January 2023. The application developed by Emma and Malvika, and reviewed and supported by Kirstie and Arielle, will work towards creating resources for professionalising data science roles, drawing from and contributing to The Turing Way and TPS work.
* The Turing Way Practitioners Hub's funding from the Ecosystem Leadership Award concluded in September. InnovateUK BridgeAI funding will continue, which has awarded £ 574,000 till 2025. The allocation of the budget for recruitment is under discussion and pending approval.
* A funding proposal was submitted to the Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) ($5000) to support ongoing accessibility work within the project by key volunteers. The application was not successful, however, the application was repurposed to make a separate submission to the Society of RSE Trustees for £1000 that can offered to support Liz Hare’s work in supporting accessibility recommendations in The Turing Way and the Book Dash.
* A proposal by 2i2c/JupyterHub which was funded last year under CZI EOSS is being rescoped to have closer collaboration with The Turing Way team in 2023-2024. This will be an opportunity to guide how to adopt or replicate TTW resources in different communities. The remaining budget in this proposal is around $230,000.
* A funding proposal was submitted by The Turing Way Core Team members to the Digital Infrastructure Insights Fund (DIIF) to support the ongoing work of the Translation and Localisation team. Written by (in alphabetical order): Batool Almarzouq, Arielle Bennett, Melissa Black, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, Malvika Sharan, Elisabeth Wadge and Kirstie Whitaker, the proposal is shared on The Turing Way GitHub: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/proposals/digital-Infrastructure-insights-fund.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/proposals/digital-Infrastructure-insights-fund.md), as well as shared with the CZI Open Science team. The requested funding will be in the range of $100,000 - 125,000, which will discussed only after the proposal is shortlisted (decision due on 25 October).

## Awards/recognition

* Malvika and Alexandra also **submitted a nomination** for The Turing Way for the Royal Society Research Culture Award in February 2023, which was not successful, however, the team was invited to resubmit in November with new updates.
