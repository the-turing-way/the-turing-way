- Choose a good IDE with debugger, Git. ok integration, learn to use it fully, is worth it!
- Difference between software & repo code with data
- Writing tests (research code examples not software engineering examples)
- If most of the process is automated but a small step needs to be manual (e.g. downloading data), how can we make that reproducible?
- unit test best practices
- Gain confidence in sharing early
- Best practice when working with proprietary data
- Focus on benefits from RR, what does it do for my career?
- What should not be reproducible (crime victims, ...)
- Numbered lists preferable
- Distilled information
- How to do reproducible research with data that can never be shared (e.g. health data)?
- Mentoring community around manual (e.g. build connections with experts as incentive)
- Maths and stats doesn't have a framework for sharing beyond papers (at least not obviously)

* model structure for maintaining GitHub repositories (scaffold)
* best practice, e.g. I wish I had known about version control, Docker, Binder, etc. at the beginning of my PhD rather than spending a lot of time now reproducing it
* (some of it) accessible to humanities/social sci scholars  
  * case studies/interviews w/ HSS researchers  
  * horror stories  
  * new user friendly  
  * clear requirements
