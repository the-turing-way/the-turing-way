# Collaborating Project and Organisations

*When members participate in The Turing Way community with the in-kind support of their funders and organisation, we acknowledge each member individually and list their organisations as “Collaborating organisations”.
Such organisational supports are applicable when one or multiple members from a project or community collaborate to build resources in The Turing Way.*

## [Delft University of Technology - Faculty of Applied Sciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences)

The Faculty of Applied Sciences is the largest of Delft University of Technology and focuses on finding innovative solutions to some of the problems faced by society.
Development of the fundamental knowledge needed to underpin technical developments that can be widely used throughout society.
In ensuring that this knowledge can be shared efectively with the wider society, the Faculty values the sharing of data and code and has a [Research Data Management policy](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies/) in place since 2020.
In this effort, the contributions from the Faculty of Applied Sciences have mainly focused on the Reproducible Research Chapter of _The Turing Way_.

* Short bio:
> I'm a Data Steward at the Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Applied Sciences, in the Netherlands, where I support researchers with their data management and open science practices. For my PhD research, I analysed human teeth for their isotopic/chemical composition in order to say something about human mobility patterns (fields of forensics, archaeology, osteology). Next to the Turing Way I'm also involved with other teams, such as the [Open Research Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.org/) ([follow the calendar on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)), [IsoArcH](https://isoarch.eu/) and I was an [OLS3](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/) mentor! I'm also interested in anything related to physical samples in research, and I'm a co-chair of the [Research Data Alliance Physical Samples Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).

* Personal highlights:
> Thanks to the Turing Way I really learned how to work collaboratively using GitHub. The book dash in February 2020 was a great kick start to actually practise and directly apply these skills, which now allows me to contribute more confidently to other projects as well! I primarily contributed to the Reproducible Research Chapter, to the Research Data Management section. I reviewed existing content and I'm working on adding a section on Data Management Plans and how to handle personal data. I also made a [The Turing Way poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4263403) that I presented during a conference. I hope to pay it forward and facilitate others in learning how to work with GitHub through The Turing Way or The Carpentries workshops. I'm very grateful to be part of this great and inclusive community!

* More information:
> I think scientific research should be accessible to anyone that would like to learn and contribute.
> I'm hoping to bring together specialists from my research field to establish guidelines for isotopic data from human remains and guidelines for how to handle and document physical samples.
I'm a co-chair of the Research Data Alliance group [Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).
Please do get in touch if you work with physical samples and would like to get involved!
> I'm part of the Open Research Calendar Team.
This is a calendar that you can use to stay up to date with open research events, or add your own events to in order to increase visibility.
Visit us at the [Open Research Calendar Website](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/) or follow the calendar on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)!

> The 2021 May Book Dash was an exciting opportunity for me to look behind the organisation scenes and to be a part of an amazing team. The week itself was absolutely amazing, especially the discussions and the 'show and tell' session!

## [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)

The Netherlands eScience Center is the Dutch national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. Their main goal is to enable scientists with varying computing experience to fully utilize the potential of the available e-infrastructure and allow them to achieve otherwise unreachable scientific breakthroughs. The Netherlands eScience Center is primarily funded by the national research council (NWO) and the national e-infrastructure organization (SURF) of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands eScience center maintains [its own guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) for reproducible software development. The focus of the eScience center guide has a big overlap with _The Turing Way_ and therefore it makes sense to avoid duplicating efforts. The eScience center contributes to _The Turing Way_ in the areas which are relevant for the eScience guide. The eScience guide points to _The Turing Way_ in when information would otherwise be duplicated.

Details of each members with their contributions have been listed alphabetically.

### Carlos Martinez Oritz

* Role: **Community manager**, Book Dash November 2020 attendee/helper
* GitHub id: [c-martinez](http://github.com/c-martinez)
* ORCID: [0000-0001-5565-7577](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5565-7577)
* Short bio:
> Carlos obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Exeter. Afterwards he worked on various research projects at the University of Exeter and Plymouth University. At the eScience Center, he has worked as an engineer in diverse projects in digital humanities and life sciences, developing expertise in natural language processing, linked open data and software sustainability. He is also a certified Software Carpentry instructor and is frequently involved in organising trainings.

* Personal highlights:
> We always advocate for software reuse and collaborative development of software. I love that we can do the same for software development guidelines: reuse content from the eScience guide and collaboratively develop with _The Turing Way_ community!

* More information:
> I am a big advocate of improving software quality. I am really glad that the eScience center is collaborating with _The Turing Way_ in providing guidelines and helping build better research software.

### Mateusz Kuzak

* Role: **Community manager**, Book Dash November 2020 attendee/helper
