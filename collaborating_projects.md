* Short bio:
> I'm a Data Steward at the Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Applied Sciences, in the Netherlands, where I support researchers with their data management and open science practices. For my PhD research, I analysed human teeth for their isotopic/chemical composition in order to say something about human mobility patterns (fields of forensics, archaeology, osteology). Next to the Turing Way I'm also involved with other teams, such as the [Open Research Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.org/) ([follow the calendar on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)), [IsoArcH](https://isoarch.eu/) and I was an [OLS3](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/) mentor! I'm also interested in anything related to physical samples in research, and I'm a co-chair of the [Research Data Alliance Physical Samples Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).

* Personal highlights:
> Thanks to the Turing Way I really learned how to work collaboratively using GitHub. The book dash in February 2020 was a great kick start to actually practice and directly apply these skills, which now allows me to contribute more confidently to other projects as well! I primarily contributed to the Reproducible Research Chapter, to the Research Data Management section, and to the Research Infrastructure Roles. I reviewed existing content and I'm working on adding a section on Data Management Plans and how to handle personal data. I also made a [The Turing Way poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4263403) that I presented during a conference. I hope to pay it forward and facilitate others in learning how to work with GitHub through The Turing Way or The Carpentries workshops. I'm very grateful to be part of this great and inclusive community!

* More information:
> I think scientific research should be accessible to anyone that would like to learn and contribute.
> I'm hoping to bring together specialists from my research field to establish guidelines for isotopic data from human remains and guidelines for how to handle and document physical samples.
I'm a co-chair of the Research Data Alliance group [Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).
Please do get in touch if you work with physical samples and would like to get involved!
> I'm part of the Open Research Calendar Team.

## [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)

The Netherlands eScience Center is the Dutch national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. Their main goal is to enable scientists with varying computing experience to fully utilize the potential of the available e-infrastructure and allow them to achieve otherwise unreachable scientific breakthroughs. The Netherlands eScience Center is primarily funded by the national research council (NWO) and the national e-infrastructure organization (SURF) of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands eScience center maintains [its own guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) for reproducible software development. The focus of the eScience center guide has a big overlap with _The Turing Way_ and therefore it makes sense to avoid duplicating efforts. The eScience center contributes to _The Turing Way_ in the areas which are relevant for the eScience guide. The eScience guide points to _The Turing Way_ in when information would otherwise be duplicated.

Details of each members with their contributions have been listed alphabetically.

## [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/)

Under the collaboration name OLS-4 for Turing, _The Turing Way_ collaborates with [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org), a programme that helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors.
This programme is cofounded by Bérénice Batut, Malvika Sharan and Yo Yehudi.
This collaboration offers training and mentoring to interested members from Turing and The Turing Way communities to join the OLS programme individually or in teams.
They develop Open Science aspects in the projects that they either already have been working on or want to develop in the near future.

You can see the projects that participated in the second round - [OLS-2](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/) and the third round - [OLS-3](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/projects-participants/).
This collaboration was awarded the Turing Online Training grant to support Turing projects in the fourth round ([OLS-4](https://openlifesci.org/funders)) and share materials openly in the Turing training network.
