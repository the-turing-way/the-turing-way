# Book Dash Application :books::dash:

You've heard of a Book Sprint?
One week when folks get together and write a book?
Well the Turing Way would like to invite you to a book dash! :books::dash:

A book dash is a one day collaborative event where you'll work with others to add to and improve the Turing Way book.

We're going to host you for dinner the night before, and give you the opportunity to promote any projects that you're working in that evening, and then hopefully we'll have an intense 9 to 5 day working on the book.

There are SO many people who have expertise that the Turing Way can benefit from.
The skills we're looking for include, but are not limited to:

* sci comm skills: skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications
* great examples and case studies of reproducible research
* writing new chapters (either from the wish list at https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/book_skeleton.md or beyond)
* editing the current chapters
* updating how the book looks online (css, logos, layout etc)

Successful applicants will receive travel and accommodation to attend one of our book dashes as laid out in the agenda below:

| Day 1	|     |
| ----- | --- |
