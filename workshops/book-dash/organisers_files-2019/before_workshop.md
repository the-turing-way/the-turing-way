# London

Dear book dash attendees,

We are looking forward to welcoming you to our Turing Way book dash in London in 10 days! 
We have a couple of things for you to look at before the workshop and some more information about what is happening on the day:

## Getting ready

We will ask you to contribute to the [Turing Way GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
If you're not familiar with contributing to GitHub projects, we recommend you read our chapter on [Collaborating on GitHub](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/collaborating_github/collaborating_github.html).
Our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also a good thing to read, but we will go through the main points again on the book dash day.
We hope you already have an idea of what you would like to contribute, but if you are still looking for inspiration, our [list of good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) will hopefully provide some inspiration. 
Also, a reminder that everyone who participates in the Turing Way project is expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - please familiarise yourself with its contents but we will also emphasise the main points again on the book dash day.

## Networking evening

We're looking forward to dining with you in a private room at the [Megaro Hotel](https://www.themegaro.co.uk).
The kitchen need to order in the ingredients to cook up a delicious meal, so **please pick your selection of dishes by the end of the day on Monday 20 May** (sorry for the short turn around) through [this Google form](https://forms.gle/NsU76koETkaHfsLd8).

Agenda for the evening will be as follows:  
6:30pm	Arrive at dinner venue   
7:00pm	Dinner  
8:30pm	Lightning talks  
9:00pm	Drinks and networking   
10:30pm Go home (get some sleep)  

### Lightning talks / elevator pitches
We have scheduled some time for you to give lightning talks about projects you're working on or anything else you are excited about.
Those talks do not need to be related to the Turing Way or anything you want to contribute during the book dash - they can be about data visualization, your favourite R package, eccentric keyboards, meditation and wellbeing tips, beer brewing or cross stitching.
Talks should be 3 minutes long and be without the support of slides as the venue will not be able to provide any equipment to display them.
Please let us know on arrival if you would like to give an elevator pitch.

## On the day

We are very excited that an illustrator from [scriberia](http://www.scriberia.co.uk/) will join us to document the sprint and provide some amazing visualisations for the handbook.

### Getting to the venue

We will start the book dash before the British Library officially opens at 9:30am so you will need to enter through Gate 8 of The British Library, the staff entrance on Midland Road opposite (one of the exits from) St Pancras station ([here are instructions on how to get to The Alan Turing Institute](https://whitakerlab.github.io/visit)). 
Give your name at the security desk to receive your visitor pass for the day.
A Turing Way team member will be waiting in the lobby and escort you to the Turing Institute.

### Agenda

8:30am	Arrive at dashing venue  
9:00am	Intro to the book dash  
9:30am	Team forming and brain storming  
10:30am Coffee break  
11:00am Group working  
12:30pm Lunch  
1:30pm	Group working, coffee available at 3pm  
4:00pm	Celebrate successes (group share outs)  
5:00pm	Close  

## Travel and accomodation

Those who have asked for travel support should have received your train tickets separately.
If you have asked for accommodation, we have booked you a room at the Megaro hotel where the networking dinner will be held.

If you want to get in touch ahead of the book dash, feel free to do so on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) where you can join with your GitHub account. 

We look forward to seeing you in London!
