Dear xxx,

Many thanks for your Turing Way book dash application. 
We received many great applications and can only offer a limited number of spaces to ensure the book dash is effective and all participant get adequate support from facilitators. 
Thus, we’re sorry to inform you that we will not offer a place in one of our book dashes.

We would still love to see your contribution to the Turing Way.
