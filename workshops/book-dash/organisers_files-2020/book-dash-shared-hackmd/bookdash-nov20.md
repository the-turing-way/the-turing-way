**Development sessions**

Cuckoo clock: https://cuckoo.team/tw-bookdash

Each day we will hold 3 development sessions and an one open slot where you can plan your time to interact with others, continue working or take a break as it's most sustainable and helpful for your participation.

Each development session will follow the Pomodoro technique that we also use for our coworking calls. We will use [browser-based shared (cuckoo) clock](https://cuckoo.team/tw-bookdash) to manage our time ([Coworking chapter in The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-motivation.html))

*Notes*
* [name=Your name] : comment
* [name=Malvika] Working on this issue: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1520
* [name=Paul] Working on new good first issues. See issues with the following labels `gsod2020`, `good first issue`, `retrospective consistency`
* [name=Marilina] learning about GitHub issues and pull requests, Working on good first issues.
* [name=Sophia] 30,000ft view for the contribution section. Individuals goals set for the contribution. 
* Veronika 666-> ca 1300 words, yay! 
*Asha Titus GOALS 
* GOAL 1: Ethics chapter - listen to existing team and contribute case studies of data science in government. Point out content and examples of biases in algorithmic design from Aus and UK government large scale data driven projects 
    * GOAL 2: get comfortable with github and using pull requests
    * GOAL 3: More like an interest: Having spoken to Batool, I am keen to know how data science and ethics is translated into Standard Arabic (as I have a linguistics background and v v rudimentary Arabic reading skills!). There are critical data studies journal articles I draw on for my PhD that problematise the term "data science" - I am keen to know what the discourse around data science and ethics is like in Arabic speaking practitioner communities. 
    * Examples: McQuillan, D. (2018). Data Science as Machinic Neoplatonism. Philosophy & Technology 31(2): 253-272.
Berry, D. M. (2011). The Computational Turn: Thinking About the Digital Humanities. Culture Machine 12.
See text from my article below:
> The scale and range of the epistemic break envisioned is so drastic that critics call this computational turn an ‘onto-theology’ in that it creates a ‘new ontological “epoch” as a new historical constellation of intelligibility’ (Berry 2011: 8). The growth of data science as a profession has also attracted strong criticism from scholars pointing out that the order of claims being made are almost metaphysical and reminiscent of a ‘machinic Neoplatonism’ (McQuillan 2018) where promises are being made to ‘reveal a hidden mathematical order in the world that is superior to our direct experience’.


*Report Out*
* [name=Batool] : I discussed with Paul and Neha the possibility of downloading the complete book as a pdf (to make it possible to add notes and highlight).  
    * I'll go through the documentation of MyST Markdown to figure out what can be done to fix some of the problems we discussed regarding the layout.
    * I'll also look into possible way to fix the responsiveness.
    * I'll also look into the open issues + translate README.md to Arabic (hopefully, this may help attracting volunteers to help in translating the book to Arabic).
* [name=Neha] : 
    * discussed the book's layout with Paul & Batool, summarized our points for others on Slack.
    * reviewed the Paul's consistency chapter on GitHub, almost finished.

#### ==15:30 - 17:00 UTC: coffee discussion: open source role models==

Every member of the Turing Way community is a role model for someone they know (even if they don't know that they know!)

In this afternoon's social session, we will use the time to share and celebrate our role models, the people who have inspired us to the positions we currently hold.

We will also discuss the pros and cons of having and being role models, the difference between "mentorship" and "sponsorship", and how we can support each other to promote open and inclusive practices in our local and global communities.

Please come prepared to share a short story (2 mins) of someone who has inspired you as a role model.

We hope that you will also enjoy participating in the broader discussion. You are not required to have additional questions or comments, but we welcome your thoughts.

#### ==15:30 - 17:00 UTC: coffee discussion: open source role models==

convert time: https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2020-11-09/15:30

Every member of the Turing Way community is a role model for someone they know (even if they don't know that they know!)

In this afternoon's social session, we will use the time to share and celebrate our role models, the people who have inspired us to the positions we currently hold.

We will also discuss the pros and cons of having and being role models, the difference between "mentorship" and "sponsorship", and how we can support each other to promote open and inclusive practices in our local and global communities.

Please come prepared to share a short story (2 mins) of someone who has inspired you as a role model.

We hope that you will also enjoy participating in the broader discussion. You are not required to have additional questions or comments, but we welcome your thoughts.

* Kirstie: This morning I want to do a twitter thread about jobs that are coming up to work at the Turing!! Two that are super relevant to folks in the Turing Way community!! 
* Ismael: Polishing the [landing/intro page of the Ethical Guide for Research](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1227)
* Marilina: Today I will translate presentation material of the Turing Way to Spanish language. So, this material could be used in a Phyton event in Chile.

*
* Marilina: I want to give a huge thank you to **Laura Ación** 🙏 for tweeting about The Turing Way and introducing me to this fantastic community. Malvika, Kirstie and aaaaall of you are so kind and patient. I am very enthusiastic about open science but I feel so dificult to achieve. 
* Malvika: Manyyyy people. To start with, Kirstie (not copying her) - but she has been promoting my work and supporting me a lot within work. 🌺
    * You all at Book Dash are so delightful! This week has been amazing working with you all.

* Albert: I want to thank **Malvika** and **Kristie** for their effort in organizing and for facilitating my entry into the project. It has been a pleasure to share with all the participants this week. But I want to thank all my partnerts for sharing this. (Special thanks to Kristie for the playlist on Spotify, who has been with me all week and will continue to do so)
* Emma: It must be a thanks to our inspiring leaders Kirstie and Malvika for this opportunity to experience working with lots of cool peoples and this great collaborative working approach.  I'm also going to thank the takeaway delivery person in advance for my takeaway tonight!
* Sarah: ALSO MALVIKA :sparkling_heart: :sparkling_heart: :sparkling_heart:

* Sophia: Kirstie and Malvika. I cannot say how grateful and full of joy I am to have spend this week with the Book Dash crew. It has been a wonderful paty of every one of my days. 
* Brigitta: I'm so grateful to both Kirstie and Malvika. They created a super welcoming atmosphere, and shepherded all of us to work together. I am also thankful Batool and Laura to directly collaborate with me, I promise I'll follow-up with the tasks that fell through the cracks this week.
