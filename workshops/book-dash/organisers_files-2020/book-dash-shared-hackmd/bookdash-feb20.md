:question: How you can contribute
---
**Please read and follow our project [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!** :sparkles: If you find them confusing, difficult to follow or think that information needs to be added, please let us know! This will help us improve the contributing experience for everyone going forward.

The tl;dr version for easy reference during dashing:
1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues) or open a new issue referencing your addition.
    * The [issue template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page, so all you need to do is edit the "*Lorem ipsum*" sections.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Turing Way repository to your GitHub profile.
3. Make your changes!
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
    * Open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible and add the label [WIP] to the title to designate "work in progress".
    * The [pull request template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new pull request page, so all you need to do is edit the "*Lorem ipsum*" sections.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
    * As you continue to make changes they will automatically be included in your existing pull request.
    * Change [WIP] to [Ready for review] in the pull request title when you are happy for your contribution to be reviewed and merged. :tada:

**What types of contributions can you make?**
* Check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues)

Click [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/invitations) to accept your invitation to have write access to *The Turing Way* - this gives you agency to merge your own pull requests (once approved!), review other pull requests, and add labels to issues and pull requests.

:no_bell: Turn off these notifications
---
You're going to start getting lots of notifications from The Turing Way GitHub repository :scream_cat:

You can control these at the https://github.com/settings/notifications page.

We recommend leaving the "Participating" options checked :white_check_mark: and un-checking the "Watching" boxes so you don't get a million different notifications.

Here's a useful help page: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-notifications

Octobox is a cool tool for managing your GitHub notifications: https://octobox.io

:yum: Dinner
---

- Venue: Parcel Yard - 5 mins from the British Library (we will walk together to the venue)
- Meals will be served at 19:00
- A welcome drink will be arranged upon arrival
- For the second drink, they will setup a bar tab from our main bar located only a few steps away from the function room - Please ensure that you will need to let our bar staff know the name of the room when ordering your drinks e.g. Quote: 'The First Class Lounge'

### Info for tomorrow:

* A few things that you might wanna take note of for tomorrow:
* The main entrance opens at 9:30 am, therefore you will be using the staff entrance (Gate 8 - opposite St. Pancras) when you arrive tomorrow at 8:30 am. You will check-in at the security and one of the Turing members will receive you there.
* We have arranged a quiet room for the entire day tomorrow if need a break or downtime during the event. We will also try to create a few tables for discussion and tables for quiet writing.
* If you don’t have a UK adapter to charge your laptop or phone, please let me know today so that I can arrange it for tomorrow.
* During your work, if you need to use headphones, that’s completely OK. This note is prompted by one of the feedback from a book dash participant. I have a couple of headphones which I am happy to let you use during the event :)
* We have arranged coffee, tea, and water on-site, and lunch has been organised keeping your dietary needs into consideration.

- Our event has unintentionally overlapped with the University and College Union (UCU) Strike that is starting today. Even though we are not participating in the strike, we want to show solidarity and help the relevant tweets about the UCU strike take a central stage. Therefore, we have decided to avoid posting tweets on the Turing Way, our research and the Book Dash event until Wednesday next week. We hope you will join us by retaining your tweets on these topics too until next week. ==You are instead encouraged to tweet about the UCU strike and their goals of amplifying the much-needed discussion around working conditions, fair pay, pensions, and equality in UK universities.==



### Day 2: 21 February 2020

`8:30 am`: Arrive at The Alan Turing Institite (enter via the Staff Entrance - gate 8)

## Things to capture in the event report

* Participants bringing food from their countries to share
* The DANS data card game: https://dans.knaw.nl/en/current/news/dans-data-game
* A post by Esther Plomp: https://openworking.wordpress.com/2020/02/27/the-turing-way-bookdash/

- Advertise event with what kind of support will be available. (max nights, max cost etc.)
- Providing feedback to the applicants who were not invited to the event is a great thing!
- We might need to start a bit early (1-2 hours) on the first day and end earlier before the dinner. Those who want to stay and discuss more can stay - as a few people felt that they didn't have much time to discuss their topics on the first day.
- Action point for Malvika: Create the book dash project management document
    - We should also clarify up ahead why we don't want to host longer sprints - funding, number of people, intention to involve and get them started etc.
    - Discuss the next steps in the book dash document.
- Remote joining options: discuss the pro and cons with Mateusz and his colleagues in Amsterdam
- GitHub tutorial
- Post-dash - merge fest: Decide a day
- Gather pictures
