- Wanted the afternoon session before the day to be longer - was just getting into brainstorming when it was time for dinner
- More time would have been great (but I understand that 1.5 days is already a lot to organize and pay for)
    - +1
- It was very hard to get myself to take a break, because I was so focused.
- I would've liked the event to last longer (2-3 days)
    - +1
- more time for consolidating new contributions
    - +1
    - +1
    - +1
    - +1
- would like to include a bit more of the global south (but will help to make this happen!)
    - +1
- Maybe have more time / agree together as a team / about how to edit content at the end and ensure a more consistent story is told throughout. We should be careful that the information we provide is accurate and up-to-date(in the views also of experts of that particular area) and a check after the end of dashing might be helpful.
    - +1
- Would like to see a set of next steps - how will this be followed up? Will there be post-Dash work sessions?
    - +1
- PRs to be addressed throughout the day so we can see changes and work on things that others have started
    - +1
    - +1
- Longer sessions (might go against the principle of a dash :p)
- I would have liked a crash course in GitHub :'( (everyone was super helpful though)
    - Perhaps even explicitly linking people to the section in the Turing Way book on this before the book dash? (and even before the pre-dash call?)
- Loved the self-organising of the groups but could have had a few times where we all reported back to one another within the groups
- Wish more people can join remotely
- Would love to have a post-dash check-in with others to coordinate the remaining work in progress
    - +1, especially once PRs have been merged and we can see the progress so-far more clearly
    - +1!
- Slightly dimmer lighting
- Having the event closer to home in the future would be nice :bullettrain_front:
