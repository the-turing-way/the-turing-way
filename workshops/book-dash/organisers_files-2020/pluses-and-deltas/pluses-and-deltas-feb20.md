Please add something that you would change about the Book Dash. We've never run one before and so all of your comments will be really valuable. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the ðŸ¤« at the beginning of the line.

- Wanted the afternoon session before the day to be longer - was just getting into brainstorming when it was time for dinner
- More time would have been great (but I understand that 1.5 days is already a lot to organize and pay for)
    - +1
- It was very hard to get myself to take a break, because I was so focused.
- I would've liked the event to last longer (2-3 days)
    - +1
- more time for consolidating new contributions
    - +1    
    - +1
    - +1
    - +1
- would like to include a bit more of the global south (but will help to make this happen!)
    - +1
- Maybe have more time / agree together as a team / about how to edit content at the end and ensure a more consistent story is told throughout. We should be careful that the information we provide is accurate and up-to-date(in the views also of experts of that particular area) and a check after the end of dashing might be helpful.
    - +1
- Would like to see a set of next steps - how will this be followed up? Will there be post-Dash work sessions?
    - +1
- PRs to be addressed throughout the day so we can see changes and work on things that others have started
    - +1
    - +1
- Longer sessions (might go against the principle of a dash :p)
- I would have liked a crash course in GitHub :'( (everyone was super helpful though)
    - Perhaps even explicitly linking people to the section in the Turing Way book on this before the book dash? (and even before the pre-dash call?)
- Loved the self-organising of the groups but could have had a few times where we all reported back to one another within the groups
- Wish more people can join remotely
- Would love to have a post-dash check-in with others to coordinate the remaining work in progress
    - +1, especially once PRs have been merged and we can see the progress so-far more clearly
    - +1!
- Slightly dimmer lighting
- Having the event closer to home in the future would be nice :bullettrain_front:
