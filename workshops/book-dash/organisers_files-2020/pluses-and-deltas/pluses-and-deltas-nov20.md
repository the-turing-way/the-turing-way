Please add something you liked about the Book Dash. We might use these to advertise the Turing Way project and in impact reports for our funders. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the 🤫 at the beginning of the line.

- Just being able to speak with other people interested in building The Turing Way is really exciting, and the Book Dash allows for creating these opportunities to connect!
- Working so collaboratively has been amazing! Using collaborative tools and having discussions to move work forward quickly has really worked well.
- It was a brilliant event and week, full with learnings and valuable exchanges about open (data) science and beyond. It is an event and a community to not be missed if you work with data. The Turing Way lives out to their motto of "too easy not to do" and I would add "outstandingly friendly, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive".
- I´ve felt so comfortable during this week. I´ve learned a lot about collaboration, open science and tools. I´m leaving with a lot of ideas to share and new colleagues to work with. I absolutely recommend to participate in events like The Turing Way, which is a friendly environment. Many thanks for the excellent organization! Congrats.
- Being able to collaborate with /enjoy loads of new perspectives and have things move 'quicker'
- Being part of a community - it gives you a sense that you are contributing in a tangible way to important issues like data science and its ethical/responsible use. These events are especially important as we are socially distant and increasingly isolated during Covid-19 pandemic.
- I think The Turing Way is an amazing place both in terms of the book providing space for conversations that are REALLY important for data science and are often overlooked, but also in terms of being able to meet new people, understand new perspectives and have that help evolve your own knowledge and work!
- Meeting new people interested in improving research practice. It is so refreshing to hear other people's perspectives & different ways of thinking, but with a common goal.
- Being able to engage and talk to people both internal and external to the Turing and see the different areas of work taking place and new perspectives to how collaboration can take place.
- Seeing how online collaboration can be utilised so successfully across a range of locations when people may never have the opportunity to meet in public.
- I like how diverse the Turing way community and how welcoming for newcomers regardless of their expertise.
- I pushed myself out of my comfort zone, I was able to talk a bit to people from different field and backgrounds (and i would like to continue that!). I really appreciated the "good first issue" option as it helped familiarise myself with how collaboration through github works.
- The team that set it up. This is what science/research/creation/collaboration CAN be. This project gives me hope for science. It gives me hope for the future. And it brings so much joy into my daily life that I feel humbled and honored to work alongside y'all.
- The structured working blocks really helped me stay productive and focused. I also liked I could only think about the turing way during that time because I knew it wasn't the full day and I'd come back the day after to continue.
- Felt like a true safe space to work and talk about any _hot_ topic and learn from every one.
- The group was simply lovely and welcoming, I really got a sense of community. I appreciated the opportunity to connect with so many brilliant people working on cool things. The event was also run so well, y'all adapted to the online format perfectly (it must've been exhausted for you though!). I also liked whenever I/anyone proposed an idea, it was just taken on or facilitated in some way. Nothing is ever shot down.

Please add something that you would change about the Book Dash. We've never run one before and so all of your comments will be really valuable. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the 🤫 at the beginning of the line.

- Is there a chance that some people within the Book Dash (say three) are explicitly dedicated to supporting people when technical issues crop up? The idea being that such queries can be overwhelming for only Malvika and Kirstie to help with, and having a few people dedicated to this in particular can encourage people to raise questions. - +1
    - There were 2 dedicated mentors bur maybe we did not communicate that clearly.
- The learning curve when it comes to getting across the github is a little steep. But I think the way to address this is to encourage continuing contributions once we learn how the turing way does PRs (almost like a conversation thread!). It is also a little difficult to make contributions with a team that you dont know very well and isnt in the same room with you. I do think that the ice breakers and online ways of encouraging people to be comfortable with each other works really well! I suggested emulating some of this team building approach at a recent public talk at the LSE where they were formally discussing the rise of new communication technology, the changing nature of work and thinking about digitally/synchronously working together ([link](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=429595918438981&id=6127898346)).
- Nothing comes to mind at the moment. I will tell you in the upcoming weeks if new ideas come up. One thought about how to get more people involved in The Turing Way would be to run micro book dashes, maybe. Like three-hour long events, showing how to contribute, using breakout rooms for people to work together. Like the co-working weekly space, but a bit more like a meetup kind of event, more widely publicized, with a given topic. Maybe. I know you folks have already thought hard about this and I won´t be able to summarize this in only a few minutes.
- I felt bad asking questions beacuse I felt it is very overwhelming for Malvika and Kirstie to respnd to all the questions from 8:00am to the evening. So, I think having other people responsible for answering some of the questions will be great and even help moderating some of the session.
- I found the HackMD a bit confusing to keep up with. I maybe would've preferred a different HackMD per day, but I realise that's also an organisational headache to manage.
- I like the HackMD, but I found it a bit difficult to navigate as it got bigger and bigger.
    - That's why we need hackmd book mode! :sunglasses: https://hackmd.io/c/book-example/%2Fs%2Ffeatures
- In OLS-2, there was an optional training session on GitHub -- maybe something like that is an idea for beginners? As part of a pre-event call or something?
- I like that the Collaboration Cafes are available, but it's somehow easy to skip it during the week. What I liked about the Book Dash is that it was an 'event' that I just committed to.
- I agree learning how to collaborate could  be difficult and Maybe a parallel activity just for beginners +1
- I would like the idea of having parallel activities for beginners! +1
- We could have smaller book dashes (few hours maybe), facilitated by community members (on a weekly basis perhaps)
    - There is actually bi-monthly Collaboration Cafe and weekly coworking calls in place.
- I would have more structured and opt in "discussion" rooms, and then "just work" rooms. There are times when I want to surface and discuss (and I felt other peoples' want to discuss and ideate) but sometimes I'm just in work flow and want to dive into it. Sometimes the pomodoro doesn't work perfectly with that internal work timing.


:question: Questions
---

Please add your questions about The Turing Way here

-  How is the Turing Way 'advertised' to people to encourage engagement and contributions?
    -  Kirstie: I feel like we need to ask folks to forward the newsletter t
    -  [name=Sophia] collaboration cafe?
- What is the general credentials required to start writing a chapter? Is it just research or would you prefer they come from greater experience?
-  [name=Batool] I was wondering if the website (Jupyter book) is accessible for disabled users (e.g. visually impaired users)?
    -  [name=Paul] At the moment we're working on making the book as accessible as possible to all kinds of readers.. part of that work is making sure all images have alt text for readers who rely on a screen reader. We're also experimenting with how we can improve the layout of the book
    -  [name=Sam] Maybe we should look into this extension? https://jameslmartin.github.io/jupyter-a11y/
        -  [name=Paul] This is pretty cool. I will play around with it in the coming weeks.
        -  [name=Batool] Thank you so much Paul. I'll also try to play with Jupyert Book layout and see if it can be improved. Thank you Sam for always suggsting cool extensions, I'll look into it.
- Something that came up during the discussion in the development session in the morning was to do with sharing and making the final jupyter book accessible to its intended audience. Senior academics (who would benefit from the material on reproducible data science and ethics discussions) and senior tech/govt managers still think in terms of physical books and reports. Ismael suggested having a bot that collates a yearly curated version into a pdf or digital book that can be cited and shared to mailing lists like responsible_data@lists.theengineroom.org and to those making decisions about data in govt.


:family: Staying involved
---

If you have ideas on how you can stay involved in The Turing Way going forwards please add them here.

- I think an "easy" way to get more people involved is by emphasising that reviews of chapters are also acknowledged contributions (because of how GitHub is so good at version control). I will definitely continue thinking and writing on topics in the book. I just think I will ask people to joing by inviting their comments rather than full chapters. This could also help them get used to GitHub and maybe in the future, well, *commit*.
- I feel we made massive amount of progress during this week, but it would be great to somehow keep the momentum going between book dashes. +1
- I'm sure the ethics book is going to bring about many interesting conversations. Even if not writing a chapter, opinions and experiences matter a lot here, so I'm sure anyone that's practiced data science would have valuable insights to provide here. I'd love to both be part of the conversation but also keep writing wherever I can!
- I will continue to contribute to the PRs where I was already contributing and get more time to the Ethics Book
- I will keep drafting the dataviz and preregistration chapters hoping that someone else wants to collaborate with me to write them!
- Monthly followups with cohort? (like how we have coworking hours).
- "coworking sessions". The thing that makes Turing Coworking hours SO accessible is how I can come in and just cowork on ANYTHING for an hour. And then I realize that an hour reviewing PRs (or similar) is SO EASY.  If we had once a month "BookDask Cohort 4" coworking hour then we can easily work it into our schedules and maintai the community. Could be done on a "rolling responsibility" basis (similar to OLS where a fellow runs a weekly coworking session).
- I'm a little worried I won't end up at the Collaboration Cafes (even though I want to) because I'm terrible at planning my schedule. I think because it's so open-ended/vague. Maybe there can be 'themed' Collaboration Cafes too? Say one that focuses or reviewing, another on good first issues, another focusing on 1 chapter...then when something relevant to you shows up, you knooow you have to show up!
