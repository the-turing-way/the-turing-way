## About the _Turing Way Project_, book dash events and all the logistical requirement for the upcoming book dash

The Turing Way is a lightly opinionated guide to reproducible data science and research. A Book Dash is a one day collaborative event where you'll work with others to add to and improve the Turing Way book.

There are SO many people who have expertise that the Turing Way can benefit from. The skills and contributions that we're looking for include, but are not limited to:

- science communication skills: skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications
- great examples and case studies of reproducible research
- writing new chapters
- editing the current chapters
- updating how the book looks online (css, logos, layout etc).

### Getting prepared for the book dash
We will ask you to contribute to the [Turing Way GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join. If you're not familiar with contributing to GitHub projects, we recommend you read our chapter on Collaborating on GitHub. Our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also a good thing to read, but we will go through the main points again on the book dash day. We hope you already have an idea of what you would like to contribute, but if you are still looking for inspiration, our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) will hopefully provide some inspiration.

### Online drop-in session on 12th February
We will hold two calls on the 12th of February (1-hour each) for you to drop-in and get your questions and concerns related to the Turing Way project, GitHub skills, or book dash logistics addressed by the Turing Way team members. The first call will take place at 8:00 am GMT and the second call will take place at 16:00 pm GMT. You can sign up on this HackMD to mark your attendance.

### Getting to the venue
On 20th February, you can arrive at the venue using the general entrance to the British Library, [here are instructions on how to get to The Alan Turing Institute](https://whitakerlab.github.io/visit). The institute is located on the first floor. You will be asked to sign in at The Alan Turing Institute’s reception, after which you can join the Turing Way team and the other participants at the social area.

On 21st February, we will start the book dash before the British Library officially opens at 9:30 am so you will need to enter through Gate 8 of The British Library, the staff entrance on Midland Road opposite (one of the exits from) St Pancras station . Give your name at the security desk to receive your visitor pass for the day. A Turing Way team member will be waiting in the lobby and escort you to the Turing Institute.

Introduction and networking on 20 February (optional)
We're looking forward to welcoming you on 20 February for a short introduction session at The Alan Turing Institute, followed by a dinner. Participation is optional but highly encouraged. We will briefly introduce the book dash events and facilitate discussion to allow you to sketch out your plan for the next day.

We will share more details about the dinner location and menu soon.

#### Agenda for 20th February will be as follows:
3:00 pm onward:  Arrive at the book dash venue
4:00 pm:  Intro to Turing Way and book dash
5:00 pm:  Brainstorming in groups
6:30 pm:  Arrive at the dinner venue
7:00 pm:  Dinner
8:30 pm:  Lightning talks*
9:00 - 10:30 pm:  Drinks and networking

### Lightning talks
We have allocated some time for you to give lightning talks about projects you're working on or anything else you are excited about. Those talks do not need to be related to the Turing Way or anything you want to contribute during the book dash - they can be about data visualization, your favourite R package, eccentric keyboards, meditation and wellbeing tips, beer brewing or cross-stitching. Talks should be 3 minutes long and be without the support of slides as the venue will not be able to provide any equipment to display them.

Group working and content development on 21 February
On the main book dash day, you can start working in groups (or individually if you prefer)

#### Agenda for 21st February will be as follows:
8:30 am:  Arrive at the dashing venue
9:00 am:  Intro to the second day of the book dash
9:30 am:  Group working starts
10:30 am:  Coffee break
11:00 am:  Group working continues
12:30 pm:  Lunch
1:30 pm:  Group working continues, coffee available at 3 pm
4:00 pm:  Celebrate successes (group share outs)
5:00 pm:  Close

### Travel and accommodation
If you have asked for accommodation and travel support in the registration form, you will be contacted by the Turing Way team members separately with further details.

If you want to get in touch ahead of the book dash, feel free to do so on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) where you can join with your GitHub account.
