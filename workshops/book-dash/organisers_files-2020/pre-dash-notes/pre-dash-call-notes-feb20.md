## Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

### Agenda

- Introductions (get to know each other)

- Your time at the Book Dash: (10 min breakout room)
    - Please discuss the following points, and bring back any questions that emerge during your conversation
      - We don't expect you to know all the answers already!
    - What you wish you had known about data research when you started a recent project (as a researcher or a colleague of data researcher)?
    - What do you want to work on at the book dash?
    - Where do you see your idea/content/idea for Turing Way fits in the current book?
- Your notes and questions from the breakout:
    - Some researchers think that ethics is an unnecessary burden, I wish they didn't think about ethics as a different field.
    - Version control
    - It's easier to work with junior researchers as they are still learning, and senior researchers may find it harder to adapt
    - People need more practical examples (application on human life compared to methodology development)
    - Data scientists from public domain understand the importance of best practices.
    - Teach data management to early stage researchers
    - Knowledge about data management can help researchers in better designing their projects from the very beginning.
    - There's an interesting relationship between data management and education (especially for undergraduates)
    - Always find documenting as I work difficult - how to make this easier and more habitual

**What do you want to work on at the book dash?**
    - Adina: I want to as useful as I can be, so I will adapt myself as per the need at the book dash. But have identified contents for contribution.
        - development of "Make" [like here](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/reproducible-paper.html#automation-with-existing-tools) and version control for data, mentions and use of tools and their usability
    - Christina: Will work on ethics but only a small part at the event (low hanging fruit) - key points required in the creations of data science research.
        - Will refrain from advising best practices - but will point to some important questions and resources.
    - Frances: will work on incorporating info in identifiers into the book in various ways, need to read the book again to work out where!
    - Front-end dev to add language switch button

- About the Turing Way project
    - Bookness of the book keeps evolving - it is a resource to help do data science. There are alot of information available on the internet but it is difficult to find the right skills and right resource.
    - Turing way is an open science, community driven book project that aims to help people do ethical and reproducible science too easy not to do!
    - Needs as many different people from different backgrounds as possible for contributing new and reviewing/editing existing content to be as accessible and comprehensive as possible
- About Turing Way Book Dash
    - Book dash (name evolved from book sprint) aims to bring people of different backgrounds together and provide them with a place to work with others with complementing skills or work on their own uninterrupted by creating new content, or using their existing content for the Turing way.

- Open questions: (feel free to write them below):
    - How do the six volumes fit with the current structure of the book?
        - Current structure is lots of chapters - would like the book to look like is six volumes with chapters sorted into them
        -- Note on 6 volumes: Topic for 6 volumes are:--
            - Reproducibility
            - Design
            - Communication & Outreach
            - Ethics
            - How to collaborate
            - Meta-Turing-Way
        - Report on [6 volume book on hackMD](https://hackmd.io/zVTeKhG2SIiBLam1YtILNg?view) 
        - GitHub content on this [pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/812)
    - What is the bigger vision of the project?
        - Book solves the immediate issue.
        - In future this book can become series of curricula, videos, podcast etc.
        - The bigger picture is community, fostering and empowering them.
        - We also want to leverage the power of jupyter notebook (interactivity) - make book for 21st century.
        - We want to encourage people to create modular and interoperable components.

- Jade is one of our helpers at the event!
    - Attended book-dash last year in Manchester.
    - Started by revising a chapter, learned github and had a positive experience - and is returing to help at the upcoming book-dash (and we very delighted to have her! <3)

- UCU strike!
    - happening/starting [during the event](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10621/UCU-announces-14-strike-days-at-74-UK-universities-in-February-and-March)
    - We won't be sharing officially anything online at the time of strike to show solidarity! you can join in by not posting things on social media.

- Closing

### Agenda

- Introductions (get to know each other)
- About the Turing Way project
- About Turing Way Book Dash
    - Open questions: (feel free to write them below):
    - How is this session supposed to work? do we need to come with idea or we will have the time at the event to identify what we want to do?
        - There are multiple ways:
            - We can work on our own in a few sessions (20-25 pomodoro), where people can pick something from their own expertise and resource and write them.
            - You can join the collaboration cafe on 19 feb and speck a couple of hours identifying your place in the project and book.
            - Writing is not the only purpose (though one main aspect), but we are happy to get editing expertise on the book dash in a group format. Important is to be engaged and aim to develop something that is engaging for everyone.
    - Do you have a plan for what the 6 volumes will each contain? And are we working on just one volume or content for all 6?
        - Topic for 6 volumes are:
            - Reproducibility
            - Design
            - Communication & Outreach
            - Ethics
            - How to collaborate
            - Meta-Turing-Way
        - Report on 6 volume book on hackMD: https://hackmd.io/zVTeKhG2SIiBLam1YtILNg?view 
        - GitHub content on this pull request: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/812
    - How do we integrate our content in this book?
        - During the book dash the core team will review and merge.
        - We don't have a huge number of people in the community who feel empowered, but we want to design that pathway and rules for merging on the GitHub.

- Helpers at the event: Jade is one the helpers 🥳️
    - Jade attended the last book dash and had a positive experience attending the event, by feeling actively being involved in the process.
    - Book dash is supposed to be how you want to use this event: workspace, networking, learning about the community through your

- Your notes:
    -

- UCU strike! - during the book dash

#### Wondering where to start?

Here are a few suggestions for a good first contributions:

- Review an existing chapter by suggesting a few changes in [the book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) and/or [repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
- Flag the unclear or duplicated information in the book by opening an [issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues).
- Fix an [old issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues) or comment on the the [pull requests](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls).
- Write your personal experience of reproducible research in this [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/akFqZEIy2kxAjfZW2).
- See more info on the GitHub: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md
