:dart: Goal setting exercise: Breakout
---

We would like to help create some plans and topics they you would like to explore for your contributions in _The Turing Way_. 
- Please note that this goal setting can relate to the suggestions made the reviewers based on your application (see your acceptance email). 
- We will be delighted to work with you to make sure that you are excited about your contribution to the Book Dash event. 
- These topics can be something that is either missing in the existing chapters or need to be updated in the project.
- You personal motivation could also be to collaborate with others at the event to work on and support what they are working on
- We also recognise - and celebrate the fact - that plans may change once you meet the other participants!


Setting our personal goals will help us prepare better for your participation:
- **S**pecific: They precisely spell out what you want to accomplish and usually answer the 5 Ws (Who? What? Where? When? Why?)
- **M**easurable: They provide a specific indicator of success.
- **A**ttainable: They are realistic.
- **R**elevant: They are important and practical.
- **T**ime-bound: They specify a deadline for when the goal will be met.

### Your comments and questions from the goal setting exercise:

* [name=Kirstie] **Emma** had a really great idea around improving the ramp up for GitHub / GitHub in the browser / alternatives to GitHub. I'm going to add a few thoughts here to capture them.
  * I'd love for the onboarding for GitHub to be in the **Collaboration** book. I have a personal soapbox about git and GitHub being _very_ different and serve different purposes.
  * I'm really keen for a chapter / section that details the different philosophies about learning GitHub. The traditional way is to learn everything about version control (git) first and I tend to err towards a "get stuff done and then feel motivated" angle, and also to recognise that GitHub is a collaboration tool that allows you to USE a very powerful version control tool. 
  * I'd also really love to see a conversation about different types of version control. I'm quite committed to git / GitHub rather than google drive / dropbox / Microsoft365 because the git/GitHub skills really open up a LOT of additional collaborative pathways - its very hard to enter the FOSS ecosystem without them. BUT that isn't explained anywhere in the Turing Way so far so it would be really great to have a page to reference! 
* [name=Kirstie] It's really interesting how psychology have convolved preregistration with open science. I think it will be SO helpful to have **Marta's** contribution on preregistration to be able to disentangle the very many different types of "openness" :sparkles:

### Wondering where to start?

Here are a few suggestions for a good first contributions:

- Review an existing chapter by suggesting a few changes in [the book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) and/or [repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
- Flag the unclear or duplicated information in the book by opening an [issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues).
- Fix an [old issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues) or comment on the the [pull requests](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls).
