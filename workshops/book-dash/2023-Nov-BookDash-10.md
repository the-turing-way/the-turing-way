### Highlights
   * 34 issues and 42 pull requests were submitted on a spectrum of topics – from data hazards to project management, data feminism, academic-industry collaborations, mental health, accessibility, and beyond
   * We had an in-person hub in London, but had online sessions spanning multiple time zones throughout the week, with special addition for Americas friendly timezones.
   * Arielle Bennett and Emma Karoune kicked off the social sessions with an exciting session about "Adding images into the book" where participants were given templates and guidelines to help them insert Scriberia images from the archive into the book with alt text.
   * Kirstie Whitaker and Susana Roman Garcia led 'Show and Tell' Lunch sessions in English and Spanish, respectively, opening the door for more multi-lingual sessions at future Book Dashes.
   * Richard J. Acton led a social session about 'Licensing', preparing [interactive materials and exercises in order to understand how they affect open source practices](LINK).
   * Two Community Share-outs were hosted by Anne Lee Steele (should I add my name here?), where Book Dash participants shared with the rest of the community and fellow Book Dash Participants what they were focused on during the week, where help was needed and to celebrate their collective achievements.

### About the Book Dash Event 

*The Turing Way* Book Dash is the bi-annual contribution event of The Turing Way Community. It is called a Dash (instead of a Book Sprint), because it aims to be a short event. During the Book Dash participants collaboratively work on *The Turing Way* book to propose new topics, discuss ideas, develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. Participants can also  contribute to improving the ways we work in the community and take the lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects. For more information, look at: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html)

### Format of the event
   * The November edition of Book Dash featured 17 invited contributors, 12 committee members, 2 external facilitators, 14 online working sessions, four discussions and social events, and two community share-outs.
   * In the past, we have organised 1-1.5 day-long Book Dash events in person or partially remotely.
   * However, since November 2020, we have been hosting Book Dashes online and with multiple short co-working called development sessions spread over 5 days for flexible participation by members.
   * We developed this format to allow people in different time zones to participate with the same efficiency and equitable support.
   * This involved creating multiple small development sessions throughout the day, adding dedicated sessions for informal social interactions, developing shared documents with all the information, providing support funds to ensure that everyone can comfortably participate and hosting a pre-event call to communicate these resources to everyone.
   * Like the previous Book Dashes in 2022 and May 2023, this time we also had a local hub hosted in London at The Alan Turing Institute with modifications introduced for the in-person participants to plan their day offline.
   * This Book Dash also had an additional contribution session each day for the Americas timezone. This was at 20:00 to 21:30 UTC. This had only been done in an informal way at previous Book Dashes. 

### Application, Review and Selection process

   * As in the past, we invited applications through an open call where interested applicants could state their goals and interest in the Book Dash. 
       * Previous attendees and long-term members of the community were also invited to sign up as mentors for new contributors and session leads as part of the application process
   * Applicants were asked to describe what they wanted to contribute to the Turing Way during the Book Dash, and how they would collaborate and engaqe with other participants.
   * To get a sense of the time zones these applicants came from, we asked them to choose their preferred slots during the day that they could join. 
   * The Book Dash Planning Committee used the rubrics (as explained in the online chapter) to score the applications during the review. They met online to discuss applications, frame feedback and conclude their selection process.
   * Relevant sub-chapter: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application)
   * In the future, applications will include a wider range of timeslots for participation, and may also benefit from additional explanations of the type of work which is completed during a Book Dash. 
### Hosting sessions 

   * Along with Anne, we started a new issue to create the Book Dash Planning Committee subchapter ([https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367)](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3367)). The main idea was to create checklists for day lead(s) and session host(s). 
   * We circulated these WIP checklists through the planning committee so that they can be tested live during the book dash itself and we also received some feedback on it.
   * The checklists involved tasks for both the primary and secondary day leads and session hosts.
   * For the day leads, the checklist was divided into 3 parts: before the day they lead, during the day they lead, and after the day they lead ends.
   * For the session hosts, the checklist was divided into 3 parts (for both contribution and social sessions): before session, during session, and after the session. The checklist provided a technical orientation to hosting as well as describing the role of host.


### Accessibility Assessment 

   * The Book Dash organizing committee sought input from the community on ways to improve the accessibility of the event for people from marginalized groups.
   * Two social events were held in Spanish.
   * Collaborative documents were moved to the Framapad platform as a more screen-reader-accessible option than HackMD. Framapad was also an improvement over the Software Sustainability Institute's Etherpad instance, which was unstable with multiple simultaneous participants.
   * The Accessibility Working Group was joined by two colleagues from Metadocencia, Patricia Lotto and  
   * Jesica Formoso, who shared expertise in leading accessible events and educational experiences
   * The Accessibility Working Group met early in the Book Dash to plan work on the TTW accessibility Policy and review the chapter "Planning Inclusive and Accessible Events" for the Guide to Collaboration authored by Sophia Batchelor.
   * Patricia and Jesica provided complete reviews of the chapter. Liz provided advice and started discussions at the Book Dash and on GitHub on the overall structure and also considerations of the identities of readers and people who will benefit from this work.

   * The Translation and localisation chapter in the Community handbook received some updates by María Nanton to add more detail to the use of glossaries in the translation workflow and to bring some key documentation that was in Crowdin to the main guide. Some links were made to other chapters in the book to integrate good practices when creating or updating content: in the style guide, a call to write "localisable" content was added–so that the original text in English is easy to translate–and an invitation to improve and update Alt-text that might be incomplete before translating it. The Spanish-specific translation guidelines were also created. Merged PR [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3431](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3431)
   * Add new resources to Open Education [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3412/files](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3412/files)

### Our attendees also led and participated in the following informal discussions and public events:**
   * On day 1, the social session was used as a short imageathon sprint to upskill participants in how to add images to The Turing Way book and then get participants to add images. This also involved discussing and writing alt text for the images.  Slides from the training can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J\_U6KK7GMtQEAhGnv2Nb\_v9B8\_vJ63pYHFkH9qIVG2k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J\_U6KK7GMtQEAhGnv2Nb\_v9B8\_vJ63pYHFkH9qIVG2k/edit?usp=sharing) and Issues and PRs were centralised in this issue: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3331](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3331) . We managed to add 13 images over the Book Dash week. 
   * On day 2, we had two show and tell sessions - one in English and one in Spanish. These are fun, social sessions where the Book Dash participants share something from their work or personal life that they think will interest the group. Topics brought by participants in this session ranged from a love of Quarto to academic paper tracking, team building in nature in Uganda to a love of eating eggs, and sporty topics like roller derby, power lifting and charity bike rides. 
   * On day 3, we had a creative writing session from Jonny Writes words.
   * On day 4, the social session was hosted by Richard Acton and he led a discussion session on Licenses, IP, \& Digital Ownership. Activities from the social session can be found on this shared document: [https://hackmd.io/Q0gEz9x6Rqm6fAiscfNF4Q?view](https://hackmd.io/Q0gEz9x6Rqm6fAiscfNF4Q?view) and this topic links to the following topical PRs: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3142](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3142) (see: [https://deploy-preview-3142--the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing)](https://deploy-preview-3142--the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing)).
   * On day 5, we hosted two public share-out sessions!

   * Name: Alejandro
       * Appreciations
           * Amazing week with new and old faces in TTW book dash
           * Nice chats with Maria N and Patricia from Metadocencia about the history of the Spanish translation team and trainings on satellite image technologies
           * Calum for quickly capturing complex ideas into nice illustrations
           * Anne F for joining the Scriberia session with Calum
           * Accessibility funds of the Book Dash for the childcare support. Matilda had a great company and time with her babysitter, Marjana.
       * Gave back (PRs reviewed - all them amazing contributions):
           * Esther (Research Data Management): very interesting stuff about Data Repositories 
           * Maria (TTW Spanish Translation Guidelines): thank you for bringing fresh ideas!
           * Julien C (Open Hardware): very insighful for me and pertinent for some colleagues working on Open Hardware for Environmental monitoring and education 
           * Richard (Ethical Licensing): this requires further reading, but it was so informative to learn about the fundamental freedoms of free/libre software and ! This is very relevant to a project I'm participating about Open Computer Vision.
           * Notes:
               * Alejandro's sixth week, very nice week hahaha late

## Pluses 
At the end of the event, we asked our participants to share feedback anonymously in the “Pluses and Deltas” HackMD.
We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.

Copy from: [https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-bookdash-nov2023-feedback](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-bookdash-nov2023-feedback)
   * I really loved the accessibility, the flexibility and in general the whole community VIBE. As a github beginner, I really appreciated the support in every step, the celebration of the little steps I took and all the comments and help.
   * I really appreciated the onboarding session and the GitHub sessions. TTW is the biggest open-source project I have contributed to, and they made the process of contributing a lot clearer and approachable. +1+1
   * Accessibility is an asset of our vibrant TTW community. Thanks for all your effort to make Book Dash accessible. Just wanted to thank Book Dash organisers for all the exciting sessions and subsidising childcare. Fantastic to have this support!
   * Later sessions to support participation of folks in americas timezones worked really well and we should keep these for the next Book Dash to encourage wider participation from that area +1 +1
   * The pre-prepared slides with the timer videos are great! +1
   * The later sessions were also really helpful as someone who was only able to work in the evenings in the UK.+1+1
   * It was an amazing, collaborative and inclusive event; brilliantly structured and with huge energy throughout. The energy made me feel like I was able to achieve something, however small, every day. +1
   * Working with Calum from Scriberia was a joy. He immediately took my half-baked idea, turned it into something tangible and ran with it. Everyone who teaches or does research should be doing this.
   * I had the opportunity of participating in many interesting discussions regarding the accessibility guidelines. 

## Deltas
   * This was an amazing week. If I get the opportunity to do another one (which I'd love to) I'd want to take the whole week off to work on it.
       * I did that -- and it was the best thing that I could ever have done!
   * Would folks based in more eastern timezones be interested in hosting earlier sessions? +1
   * Find alternatives to EventBrite that allow better integration with the calendar and planning tools. The URL of the evening share-out was different to the one shared in the slack channel.
   * The git and GitHub intro session was genuinely excellent, but I think it might also be worthwhile considering a session for people who understand git, but don't necessarily understand how TTW uses git. It's not like other projects I've worked on previously in this respect, which isn't a criticism at all, but it does take time/effort to get to grips with the conventions (even though they are largely detailed in TTW itself).+1 +1 
       * I didn't attend the git + GitHub session but I imagine that this session on git would need to be extremely hands-on as well. I also think a workshop should show how we could work in an editor like VS Code (which I was using) and push our edits. It's so much nicer with a GUI that is local in your computer and not a flimsy website (like GitHub) where your edits might disappear if you accidentally reload the window or something...
   * I think that including subtitles to the sessions it would helpful for not native folks. +1 (also for those of us who are a bit hard of hearing)
   * Recording audio for videos is difficult for the share-outs

## What’s next?

   * **Changes Suggested for future Book Dashes**
       * Preparing color pallete for TTW: color-blind friendly, ensures continuity in design
       * Re-doing image social session on Monday: very popular session!
       * Zoom link must be opened by a Turing staff member (need lots of alternative hosts!)
       * Review how the RCM \& RPM are distributed throughout the day, and how Committee is distributed throughout the sessions for different timezones
       * Review timezones for the sessions overall, and capturing that information from participants
       * Will be moving away from Eventbrite platform for future Book Dashes
       * Review application process
   * Take a lead on addressing some of the concerns raised on the Delta feedback
