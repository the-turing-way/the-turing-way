## Overview to share publicly (newsletter)

We are very excited to introduce you to our Book Dash participant!

![Screenshot of the Book Dash attendees. Described in the title below.](https://i.imgur.com/KRfx5Ra.jpg)

*Book Dash attendees in the first row: Nina di Cara (panel 1), Malvika Sharan (panel 2), Becki Green (panel 3), second row: Kirstie Whitaker (panel 2), Aida Mehonic (panel 3), third row: Lotty Coupat (panel 1), Hannah Nicholls (panel 2), Esther Plomp (panel 3), fourth row: Maria Cristina Nanton (panel 3), fifth row: Brigitta Sipőcz (panel 1), Emma Karoune (panel 3), sixth row: Mariana Vivas (panel 1) and Batool Almarzouz (panel 3). In this picture, we also have several attendees from our share-outs including Martin O’Reilly, Ismael Kherroubi-Garcia, Danny Garside and Paul Owoicho who are involved in the project. Book Dash attendees who are not in the picture are Ali Humayun, Andreea Avramescu, Andrei Alexandru, Marta Mangiarulo, Arielle Bennett, Carlos Martinez-Ortiz and Laura Carter.*

These members had sent applications describing what they would like to work on and how they intend to collaborate with other contributors.
Application review was carried out using the rubrics described [here](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-preparation.html).

### Book Dash Planning Committee

This event could not have happened without the valuable work of our first Planning Committee members: Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Brigitta Sipőcz, Carlos Martinez-Ortiz, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp and Laura Carter They provided useful input during the planning and mentored new contributors. These members were invited to join the committee as they had attended previous Book Dash events and had sent their applications expressing their interests to mentor new contributors.
Malvika Sharan and Kirstie Whitaker were involved to ensure that resources required for committee members to lead sessions and run this event were in place. 
The committee members hosted the development during the Book Dash week and led and discussion sessions on illustrations for visual storytelling, accessibility in communication, time management and activism.
We also hosted a 'show and tell' social meal and facilitated several icebreakers for social interactions.

### Resources from the Book Dash May 2021

Our Book Dash attendees worked on multiple chapters and project ideas that we have summarised below:

* Overview of new chapters:
  * “[Legal Disclaimer](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/legal-disclaimer.html)” by Laura Carter explaining where can readers find legal advice so that they do not consider any part of *The Turing Way* book as a legal guide. 
  * Malvika and Esther reorganised a chapter “[Making Research Objects Citable](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable.html#)”,  previously listed under the Guide for Reproducible Research.
  * Kirstie Whitaker wrote a chapter on “[Barriers to Reproducibility](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers.html)” describing what challenges researchers face in their research when planning to apply practices for reproducibility.
  * Batool and Brigitta collaborated on the chapters and illustrations for the [Continuous Integration chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci.html) that they started working on during the previous Book Dash event.
  * Arielle Bennett updated the chapter “[Activism for Researchers](https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism.html)” with the contributions of Bruno Camino.

* Draft for chapters inviting contributions and reviews:
  * Esther wrote a chapter on linking code and data to publication in [PR #1942](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1942/files).
  * Martina Vivas and Malvika co-wrote a chapter to provide an overview of project design.
This chapter provides a curated collection of The Turing Way chapters that are useful for planning project design for a new project.
See [PR #1936](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1936).
  * Kirstie is restructuring the Guide for Collaboration to ensure that the chapters are organised based on the types of collaboration and are easy to find.
See [PR #1935](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1935).
  * Andreea, Hannah and Becki collaborated on the chapter describing file organising template for research compendia.
See [PR #1930](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1930).
  * Maria, Marta and Emma collaborated on the chapter “Communicating with wider audiences” [PR #1929](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1929).
This is a comprehensive chapter describing different ways for ensuring scientific communication is accessible to a wider audience.
  * Lotty Coupat, community manager of AutSPACEs, added a case study from her project to the subchapter on project road mapping.
See [PR #1941](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1941). 
  * Andrei is revising the chapter on risk assessment to make sure that it is relatable for researchers beyond software engineers.
See [PR #1928](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1928).
 * Prompted by the discussions in the Community Share-outs, Danny Garside is suggesting changes in the landing page to help ensure that the readers can use the book as a knowledge base and not attempt to read it from beginning to end.
See [issue #1955](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1955).
  * Nina worked on developing a chapter describing ways to develop skills for self-reflection in data science to maintain ethical integrity in our work.
See [issue #1919](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1919).

![Nina di Cara Tweeted on 19 May 2021 saying “Day three of The Turing Way Book Dash today. What a luxury to spend a couple of days thinking deeply about self-reflection & positionality in data science work. Burnham's social 'GRACES' are getting a lot of air time”](https://i.imgur.com/GM6g577.png)
