**Please read and follow our project [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!** :sparkles: 

If you find them confusing, difficult to follow or think that information needs to be added, please let us know! This will help us improve the contributing experience for everyone going forward.

### Managing your contributions to the GitHub repository

The tl;dr version for easy reference during dashing:
1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues) or open a new issue referencing your addition.
    * The [issue template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page, so all you need to do is edit the "*Lorem ipsum*" sections.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Turing Way repository to your GitHub profile.
3. Make your changes!
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
    * Open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible and add the label [WIP] to the title to designate "work in progress".
    * The [pull request template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new pull request page, so all you need to do is edit the "*Lorem ipsum*" sections.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
    * As you continue to make changes they will automatically be included in your existing pull request.
    * Change [WIP] to [Ready for review] in the pull request title when you are happy for your contribution to be reviewed and merged. :tada:

**What types of contributions can you make?**

* Reviewers for your Book Dash application have suggested a few specific topics for each of you 
* You can also collaborate with others or start slowly by checking out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues)
* Proofread [existing chapters](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) (check for typos, grammar, links, etc.)
* Add further information to an existing chapter
* Suggest topics for new chapters (particularly if you can write them!)
    * A chapter can be minimum 3 paragraphs in length - what can you write 3 paragraphs on?
    * What skills or tools do you wish you had been taught at the start of your research career?
* Review ```[Ready to review]``` [pull requests](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls)
* Contribute to discussion in ```[WIP]``` pull requests and issues
* Incorporate case studies into the book
* Checklists for specific skill or recommendation
* Restructuring the chapter sections (like the Reproducibility chapter)
* Creative, out of the box ideas!
