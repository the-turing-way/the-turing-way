* Short bio:
> I am a Technical Writer / Google Season of Docs (GSoD) Participant working to make The Turing Way consistent, sustainable, and accessible.
> I have a BSc in Software Engineering from the American University of Nigeria. Thereafter, I worked as a Research Analyst in the Fintech & Innovation Division of Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria and helped to drive the Bank's push to become a platform by creating innovative digital products.
> I completed a MS in Data Science from the University of Glasgow and starting my PhD in January 2021 studying conversational information-seeking systems. I spent two years as a Research Analyst at Guaranty Trust Bank in Lagos, Nigeria helping to build innovative digital products to meet the Bank's customer objectives.

* Personal highlights:
> The Turing Way is my first foray into open source and has been a fantastic learning experience.
> Not only have I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for how GitHub works, but I am also learning to prioritise sustainability and empowerment in the work that I do.
> Although The Turing Way is my first open source project, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learned a lot along the way. Before the GSoD program, I only used Github to 'store' my projects. Now, I am much more proficient at using Github for collaborative endeavours and I am more adept at working with tools such as Markdown, Jupyter Book, and Sphinx. In addition, I gained familiarity with setting up and working with web analytics software.
> You can see the full report from GSoD participation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/communications/GSOD-applications/GSoD-2020-Project-Report.md).
> The BookDash November 2020 was great! It was awesome to meet, collaborate, and share ideas with people from around the world. Beyond the Book Dash, The Turing Way is the very first open-source project I have ever worked on. The experience has been fantastic, and I intend to stick around as a contributor after the Google Season of Docs program ends. I also see myself getting involved in other open-source projects.

* Personal Quote:
> Asides technical skills, I developed a deep appreciation for what working on an open source project entails. My mentors helped me realise that the value I left behind from the GSoD program was not in the amount of work I did, but how I enabled other contributors to also do the work I was doing. As a result, I learned to contribute as a Technical Writer in a manner that was reproducible, sustainable, accessible, and inclusiv
