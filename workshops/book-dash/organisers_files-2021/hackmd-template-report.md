We are delighted to share that the Xth Book Dash was hosted successfully from DD to DD MONTH YYYY with XX participants, including our planning committee members. <-- Update

### Summary to share in the Newsletter

[Update]

### Format of the event

_The Turing Way_ [Book Dash events](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash.html) are a less intense version of [Book Sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_sprint), where participants collaboratively work on _The Turing Way_ book synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. 
They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.

<!-- The November edition of Book Dash featured 18 contributors, 6 committee members, 13 online working sessions, four discussions and social events, and two community share-outs.

In the past, we have organised 1-1.5 day long Book Dash events in person or partially remote. 
However, since November 2020, we have been hosting Book Dashes online and with multiple short co-working called development sessions spread over 5 days for flexible participation by members.
We developed this format to allow people in different time zones to participate with the same efficiency and equitable support. 
This involved creating multiple small development sessions throughout the day, adding dedicated sessions for informal social interactions, developing shared documents with all the information, providing support funds to ensure that everyone can comfortably participate and hosting a pre-event call to communicate these resources to everyone. -->

### Application, Review and Selection process

<!-- As in the past, we invited applications through an open call where interested applicants could state their goals and interest for the Book Dash. This application was also open for the long term members from the community who may have attended a Book Dash or Collaboration Cafes in the past to join as a helper and mentor for new contributors as well.

Applicants were asked to think about the collaborative element of the Book Dash and state how they could engage with other participants. 
To get a sense of the time zones these applicants came from, we asked them to choose their preferred slots during the day that they can join. You can see a template of this document [here](https://tinyurl.com/tw-bookdash-template).

The Book Dash Planning Committee used the rubrics (as explained in the [online chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application.html#reviewing-process)) to score the applications during the review. They met online to discuss applications, frame feedback and conclude their selection process. -->

Feedback
--------

<!-- 
At the end of the event, we asked our participants to share feedback anonymously in the ["Pluses and Deltas" HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2021-feedback).

We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.
-->

Plus
---

<!-- 
* Having multiple sessions with a shared document was really helpful
* I loved that there were always people around to help
* I really appreciate the work done to link up people who could work on the same topics/chapters.
* I really appreciate how "people-first" the book dash is
* The warm community and ice-breaking dynamics make it super easy to start from the beginning.
* I love the illustration session and the opportunity to work with the artist!
-->

Delta
---
<!-- 
* Felt that participants needed more briefing on working with the Scriberia artists
* Maybe use a dedicated calendar tool for schedules
* Audio-only sessions?
* Running alongside existing events/conferences?
* How can we get more of our community members involved? (doing similar coordinative work as eScience centre)
* I think part of the Book Dash is getting to know your way around things so it takes a little while.
-->
