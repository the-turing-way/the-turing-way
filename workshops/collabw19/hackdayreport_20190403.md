## Our report

### What did we do?

We set out to enhance the first version Turing Way project, both in terms of actual text and the broader project goals:

* A mixture of curating and editing existing content, expanding existing content and writing entirely new content.
    * Many of the PR's below approved- we've published already!
* New content is quite novel, providing a viewpoint of practices from beyond academia.
* Build directly on an existing project- inventing another wheel would be wholly inappropriate.
* We eat our own dog food- A sustainably developed book about sustainable development!

Specifically:

* @KirstieJane restructured a long chapter into subsections: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way-book/pull/12

*GRAND META-GOAL:* The bull-in-a-chinashop actions of the team making their contributions to the Turing Way created:

1. new guidance and advice for new contributors in the future, and
2. Rules for authorship within the project going forward.

Both will enhance the project's ability to attract new contributors in the future, and so make it *even more amazing*. :gem: :gem: :gem:

### What did we learn?

* Sarah, Robin, Richard learnt how to use GitHub collaboratively.
* Rachael, Sarah and Robin all learnt how to sync a fork from upstream.
* Sarah's first pull request! :tada:
* Rich's first use of github in anger.
* Rich learned the 6th markup language he's used so far in 2019.
* Dan renewed his ongoing epic struggle with markdown syntax.
* We learned about differences in testing/reviewing outside of an academic environment.

### Judging Criteria

* Implementation and infrastructure.
* MUST be clear on how building on existing work.
* (5 minutes) Demo and presentation.
* Must show how you met criteria.
* Project transparency.
