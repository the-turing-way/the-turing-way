12/03/2019 15:05,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,I consent,Wanted to understand what Turing considers best practise ,Not sure. Think it was appropriate. Would like the BinderHub workshop to repeated in London.,Possibly. PR back into the repo would certainly make it more useful as part of a workflow tool.

12/03/2019 15:08,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,4,4,I consent,"Very useful to learn about a tool for reproducible research, software and data, and great to gain practical experience in using it to share some code. ","The workshop was very fast-paced, and it was sometimes difficult to keep up with the demonstrations. ",I will certainly use Binder in the future to share my code and make my research more open and reproducible.
12/03/2019 15:11,3,4,4,2,3,5,4,5,4,4,I consent,"Good structure. Initial examples were useful and interesting, and very conveniently prepared with clear instructions. Overall, very good attention to detail in making things easy and streamlined for participants.","I would have liked some more advanced material (e.g. configuration options, or time to play around with other examples in different languages, either from scratch or looking at the existing samples) but I understand that this is an introductory workshop with a mixed audience!","Yes, particularly for researchers we work with - for sharing analyses, showcasing libraries with complex setups/dependencies (a more directly visual Docker!), possibly building and supporting a local BinderHub instance."
12/03/2019 15:28,2,3,4,1,3,5,4,5,4,4,I consent,"Very well structured, with good balance between presentation & hands-on, and easy to follow instructions.",,I would like to investigate how Binder can be used as part of a solution for long-term preservation of computational analyses.

12/03/2019 16:02,1,2,2,1,2,4,3,4,3,3,I consent,The examples were good. The instructors were very friendly. I also really liked learning a bit about docker.,It would have been good to know that avoiding the tidyverse package would have made things faster. ,I think that I might use it for sharing my code.

13/03/2019 11:36,3,4,2,2,3,4,3,4,3,4,I consent,"You taught git / Python / Jupyter / Binder sufficient for the workshop goals, with participants have no software other than a browser (and an internet connection). This was a pleasant surprise, which will affect my teaching.

The workshop style and culture was different to where I'm used to being. Although a bit difficult during the day, in hindsight it was for me something useful for me to learn. I tend to live in the software developer bubble, but this workshop was aimed for people who had some practical task in mind (other than developing software).

The informal conversations with other participants was useful. The venue was good, and so was the location. (It might have helped, to encourage people to go outside the building at lunchtime, to get some fresh air. Or at least open the windows a bit.)","These suggestions are more precise than my experience supports. They're just ideas.

I suggest that as part of the first session you get the user's laptops set up. This would include: (a) connecting to the wi-fi, (b) getting to the workshop home page, (c) asking users to open new browser windows with appropriate tabs open in them (this may be a bit hard), (d) discover if they have accounts on github/gitlab/bitbucket (e) introduce the use of the green-red post-its

Perhaps even before the first session, provide time for the people on each table to introduce themselves to each other. 10 or 15 minutes might be enough.

Printouts of useful pages (not enough to go around - encourage sharing) on each table.

I suggest that at as part of the last session you hold a Best Practice, Discussion and All Questions Answered (as best you can) Session.","Yes, for making small pieces of Python code more accessible. However, I'm worried about the load this would place on the Binder's servers (and the poor experience that would result)."
15/03/2019 16:22,3,5,3,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,I consent,"Location was nice - in hindsight, it would have been nice to have a tour of the Institute.
Everything was well explained and well organised.","Perhaps it would have been better to warn people that R wasn't a good first language to try and to use Python instead.
Possibly provide a simple set of contents for this case.",Definitely. As a researcher / software engineer.
