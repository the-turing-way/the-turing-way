01/03/2019 14:53,4,5,4,3,3,4,4,5,3,3,I consent,Good level and pace,,"Yes, to make my code public"
01/03/2019 15:10,2,3,2,1,2,4,4,5,4,3,I consent,"Friendly atmosphere, the overview in the morning and code along, really useful.","Can't think of anything, it was great!","Yes, to share research results and for teaching."
01/03/2019 15:35,2,2,1,1,1,5,3,5,3,3,I consent,"Very supportive, good working environment",,yes
01/03/2019 15:35,4,5,4,2,4,5,5,5,5,5,I consent,It was fun to learn how easy is to use Binder.,,Yes.
01/03/2019 15:36,2,4,3,2,3,4,4,5,4,4,I consent,Good presenters. Enthusiastic. Honest in presenting limitations. Excellent overview of Turing Way.,Can we see mybinder.org being used upfront first please?,"Yes, both in presenting research I have been working on; and,
providing a binderhub service to our institutions researchers."
01/03/2019 15:36,2,2,1,1,3,5,4,4,4,5,I consent,The engagement and everyone following along with the building steps,Additional resources to follow after the course,Packaging data
01/03/2019 15:37,1,3,1,1,1,4,4,5,4,4,I consent,"Friendly, useful, and help / instructions available so you can go at your own pace",,"Yes, for showing shorter machine learning projects"
01/03/2019 15:38,3,4,4,1,4,5,5,5,5,5,I consent,I liked the format (a bit of introduction and background story and then half a day of hands-on coding) as well as the content: well-thought and very relevant. Presenters and helpers were all brilliant and extremely approachable.  ,Nothing much really!,Yes. I do not do research per-se but I do some data analysis every now and then in my work that I need to share with others in my team and this would be a perfect way for them to see my results and analyses and even play with them without having to install anything themselves.
01/03/2019 16:32,2,2,2,1,4,5,5,5,5,5,I consent,good mix of seminar-based content and interaction.  Overall I thought the workshop was *fantastic*.,maybe a little slower in the afternoon - possibly more time for the building your own binder bit,yes - in my research - and I'm also going to teach my students how to use it!
03/03/2019 15:58,3,3,2,1,2,5,4,4,3,4,I consent,The instructions on how to build a Binder (Zero to Binder) were very good. I liked the traffic light post-it notes. ,"Some assumptions were made regarding terminology (Markdown, commit, branch, ...). These could be explained a little for the uninitiated. Perhaps everyone understood, so this may not be an issue. There was a bit too much detail in places, but I quite like that. If the emphasis is on reproducibility then the use of targeting a commit when generating a Binder, rather than a branch or Master, should be emphasised. That said, the topic of reproducibility is wide and varied. ","No, at least not in the immediate future. In a few years perhaps. I work on Windows, with MATLAB and files > 2 GB, so it's not practical. "
