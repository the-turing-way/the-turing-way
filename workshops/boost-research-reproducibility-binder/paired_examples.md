# Paired Examples

For this part of the workshop, you're going to explore the following example binderised notebooks.

You don't have to work through them in order.
For example, if you're more familiar with RStudio then maybe start with example 4.

The hardest part - and we apologise for throwing you a little in the github deep end here - is that you need to know about *branches* in git.
There's a whole section of the Turing Way version control chapter about [branches](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/chapters/version_control.md#branches) but you don't need to know all that much about them just yet.
The key point is that there can be **very small differences between branches with everything else staying exactly the same**.

In the examples with branches (2, 3 and 4) we ask you to see the difference between those two branches and explain why the code runs differently.

* https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex1
  * Uses command line.
    This is a bit of a tricksy python problem.
    Follow the instructions but feel free to ask if you're not sure what's going on.
* https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex2
  * Uses Jupyter Notebooks.
    The answer is simple (don't overthink it!).
* https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex3
  * Uses Jupyter Notebooks.
    This one is really quite hard...don't try this one first!
* üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ~~https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CompEnv-Ex4~~ üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  * ~~Uses RStudio.~~
    ~~Great if you're an R user, a little idiosyncratic if you don't use R regularly.~~
  * Unfortunately, this example no longer works due to upgrades on mybinder.org.

***Please ask if you have any questions.***
This section is to allow you to explore the examples and learn by doing.
It is not a test!
We're happy to tell you the answers or give hints on where to find them if you're stuck.
