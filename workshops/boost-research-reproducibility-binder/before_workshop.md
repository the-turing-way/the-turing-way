# London

Hi!

We are looking forward to welcoming you to the 'Boost your research reproducibility with Binder' workshop in London next week! We have a couple of things for you to look at before the workshop and some more information about what is happening on the day:

## Getting ready
We have funds available for travel and childcare support if you need them. Please get in touch with theturingway@gmail.com to discuss how we can support you.

Please bring some code and some data. The code should take less than 10 minutes to run, and the data should be less than 10 MB. This might mean that you just pick one script from a bigger project, or bring a subset of your data. Note that it's really important that the code and data can be made public because we'll be using the public binder instance.

We have helpers at the event who are confident building binders for Python and R projects. They can be either scripts (`.py`, `.R`) or notebooks (`.ipynb` or `.Rmd`). If you are planning to bring code that is not written in R or Python, please let us know at theturingway@gmail.com to make sure that we're prepared for your project.

Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join.

## On the day
There is now an updated agenda: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/agenda.md available and please note that we will begin registration at 9.30am and will formally close at 4pm so that those with caring responsibilities can get home!

We are dedicated to an inclusive and supportive event. Please read the code of conduct before you come along: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. We encourage you to tweet and share your thoughts using #TuringWay, if you would not like to be included in any photographs we will have stickers you can use on your name badge to let us know!

## Travelling to the Alan Turing Institute
The Alan Turing Institute is located on the first floor of the British Library, 96 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DB. If you do not have a Turing ID card, we recommend that you enter the British Library through the main entrance on Euston Road. The Library opens at 9:30am, so please be aware that there may be a queue to enter.

Once inside the Library, take the stairs or lift to the first floor to reach the Institute. More detailed directions, as well as guidance on how to reach the Institute using public transport, are available at https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/how-get-alan-turing-institute.

If you have any questions ahead of the event please drop us an email at theturingway@gmail.com.

We look forward to seeing you in London!
