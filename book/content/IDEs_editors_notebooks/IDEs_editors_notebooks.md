## Summary
This chapter is about which software you use to write and edit your code. There are three broad categories (text editors, IDEs, and notebooks) and within those categories there are many specific pieces of software (for example vim, sublime text, RStudio, jupyter notebooks). The Turing Way won't tell you which IDE or editor to use, but it will highlight some things that you might want to consider when you're making your choice.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
<!-- why we think you should read the whole thing -->

## What's the difference: IDEs, editors, and notebooks?

### IDEs
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) integrate many [features](#features-to-know-about) that programmers find useful into one place. Rather than being only the place that you write your code, IDEs can also manage virtual environments, streamline using version control, or help you to conform to style conventions. While they can provide a lot of useful tools, they require more computational resources (which can make them slow), and additional skills to make the most of them. Some IDEs may provide features that you know you won't need (e.g. for managing)
Examples of IDEs: RStudio, PyCharm, Visual Studio

### Text editors
Text editors offer a bare-bones code-writing environment. The only feature that they will definitely have is allowing you to write the text, although most will also allow you to run it from the editor. They therefore take up less space on your machine, and can sometimes be faster to write in. Text editors are often customisable, allowing you to add new [features](#features-to-know-about) over time as they become useful to you. 
Examples of Text editors: Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code

### Notebooks

## Literate programming
<!-- Does this comes up somewhere else in the Turing Way?? - link it?) -->

## Features to know about

### Debugging

### Integrated version control

### Auto-complete

### Syntax and style highlighting

### Virtual environments
<!-- Presumably this comes up somewhere else in the Turing Way - link it?) -->

## How to choose?
- Ask your friends and colleagues what they would recommend. Knowing who you can ask questions to can be helpful when you're getting used to a new environment. 
- Decide which features you care about and choose an editor, IDE, or notebook that has those features.
- Try one out, you might cycle through a few until you find one you like.
