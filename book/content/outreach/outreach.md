## Overview

Most of the content in the Turing Way Book is aimed at improving practices in your research to ensure that
it is accessible and reproducible by other people working in the discipline. Following these practices
will improve the impact your work has among other researchers in your field. However, research impact
extends beyond improving knowledge and practice by leading to improvements for society, and researchers need
to be able to communicate these benefits to the public. Unfortunately, few researchers invest significant
time and effort into outreach, which often leads to stories about research results being
inaccurately represented in the media or important results not getting much attention. Research funding
ultimately rests on projects having clear benefits for society, and an ability to communicate these
impacts to the public and to elected officials will help ensure continued funding for research in the
future. 

This chapter focuses on best practices for outreach and communication to ensure that your research has
a broad impact outside of your immediate field. This is a challenging task, as effectively communicating
complex results to a non-expert takes practice and this skill is infrequently taught as part of the
training that most researchers receive. Ultimately, you need to approach outreach and communication more
like a journalist rather than like a researcher. Outreach involves presenting the big picture results
without necessarily going into the details that you might find interesting as a researcher, developing
relationships with people that can help disseminate your research, and advocating for data literacy
in general within and outside of your institution. We hope that the material contained in this chapter
will help you be an advocate for your own research and for your discipline and ensure that your work has
maximal impact.
