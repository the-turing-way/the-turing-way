# Developing Mutually Beneficial Science-Communication Relationships

> We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering (e.g. comms groups, journalists) by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.

## Why Relationships?

In many cases, there are three significant barriers to entry when it comes to getting your research out there:
1. Not knowing how to express the information in a way that is suitable for a wider audience
2. Not knowing who to approach with the story
3. Not having enough time to spend addressing points 1. and 2.

The most effective remedy to all three problems is to proactively establish beneficial relationships with communicators in advance.
As the comic above suggests, communication inherently involves at least 2 people.
Having that pre-existing connection, an awareness of the focusses, audience, and format of their work, and a convenient source of expertise when it comes to communicating is invaluable in reducing the time and effort needed to effectively communicate your results.

It is also worth noting that while you are approaching these relationships with the explicit intention of utilizing them to further your goal of effective outreach, this is something of a reductive view. As with any interaction, there is the probability of unforeseen opportunities arising simply by being in contact with people and organizations with whom you would not otherwise interact. Although we do not touch on these here, it is worth bearing in mind that there is more to be gained than is covered by the scope of this section.

## What Does a Mutually Beneficial Researcher-Communicator Relationship Look Like?
The key word here is "mutually". As any marriage counsellor will tell you, sustainable relationships require investment from both sides. As such, it is worth breaking down what each party has to contribute to, and potentially gain from, the other.

The most obvious interaction is the trading of content for exposure. You as a researcher produce potential content in the form of (hopefully) interesting science. Communicators employ their skills to package this information in a suitable way, and utilise their platforms to disseminate it to a wider audience than the researchers alone could hope to reach. [2]

While this simple symbiosis is vital to both parties, it does not naturally lend itself to establishing a long-term organic relationship. In most cases, individual researchers produce suitable stories too infrequently to build up much of a rapport with individual communicators or communications teams.

Thankfully, both parties in this equation have rather more to offer. Research is, by its nature, a collaborative endeavour. Therefore individual researchers are all but certain to have extended networks within their field made up of other researchers with whose work they are at least passingly familiar. Not only do they offer a potential link to this network, they also possess a wealth of context for understanding it. Finally, a researcher's expertise in their field makes them a invaluable source when it comes to related content. A researcher with whom a communicator has a pre-existing relationship is a known quantity, and may be relied upon to contribute either directly in the form of a quote, or indirectly by providing context to aid the communicator's own understanding. From a communicator's point of view, therefore, a researcher is in fact a gateway to, and guide for, an all but inexhaustible world of potential content to which they might not otherwise have had access.

Equally, a communicator has far more to offer than simply doing the work of disseminating information. Just as researchers operate within networks, so a communicator offers an access point to numerous other communicators, each with subtly different interests, schedules, platforms, styles, and audiences. Even if a particular piece of potential content is not well matched to a specific communicator's oeuvre, they may be aware of others to whom it is better suited.

Finally, it is a fact of life for all researchers that science needs to be communicated to other researchers, and for many there are teaching obligations alongside research. Despite the fact that communicators are seldom involved in these processes, the same skills in which they specialize, specifically clear and concise presentation of information and tailoring to a certain audience, are of great value here. Moreover, this is often an area in which researchers receive little or no formal training, being expected to simply pick it up as they go along. Forming long-term relationships with communicators offers an opportunity to tap both their knowledge and expertise to improve our own communication skills. [3]

## How to do this
Unfortunately, there is no easy guide to making friends, which is effectively what this section would want to be. However, this section offers some general guidelines in how to approach communicators. Bear in mind that these are by no means iron-clad nor exhaustive - everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for others.

For convenience, we have organised the tips below into two broad categories - planning and execution. Planning actions are those you can take independently in order to make yourself better prepared for building these relationships, whereas those in the execution category should help to guide you once a relationship has been initiated.

### 1. Planning

#### 1.1 Identify potential collaborators
Try to be open minded about with whom you might work. If you're looking for ideas to diversify your potential communicators, we have some suggestions in the next section.

#### 1.2 Reach out early
Establishing relationships takes time and often the limited time available for outreach in a given project timeline makes doing this on the fly, building contacts with communicators as-and-when you need them, all but impossible. The earlier these links may be established, the easier it will be to draw on them when needed, and the longer you will have to benefit from the accompanying advantages.

#### 1.3 Plan for Outreach
One consideration we particularly want to highlight is "when in the normal lifespan of a project various communicators should be brought on board?".

While there will be a large degree of individual variation in this, a general rule of thumb is that external communicators tend to favour "finished" stories and should therefore be contacted regarding the project during the final stages when there are results to discuss. Conversely, communicators internal to your organization gain more from incremental updates. For example, management and directorate members are often called upon to speak about what their institution / team / company is doing, and having up to date information on progress can be a vital resource. 

Considering when and how communicators are made aware of the project should be a part of the planning process. For a more detailed exploration of this point, we refer you to the [Integrating Outreach Into Research Projects](#Integrating-Outreach-Into-Research-Projects) section of this chapter.

#### 1.4 Don't Gatekeep Your Work
Not all stories need to be hugely flashy or impactful. As anyone working in a scientific field will tell you, discovery is in the norm a steady and incremental process. While small developments and updates aren't as attention grabbing as huge breakthroughs, however, this doesn't mean that they aren't just as interesting or worthy of reporting on. 

Combatting the tendency to disregard all but the most ostentatious results when it comes to outreach can be seen as analogous to combatting the perennial science problem of publication bias (see [4], for example), and with potentially even higher stakes since the audiences are often much broader. 

It is helpful to start from the assumption that all projects have an aspect worth talking about, after all something must make them worth doing! From this basis, getting word out becomes a case of finding the right medium or format for the story, rather than trying to find a story for a given format. This is an area where having a wide range of potential communicators available to you is a particular advantage.

#### 1.5 Be Prepared!
These two words could serve as a summary for this entire section. The more groundwork you can lay, the more contacts you can build, and the more thought you can put into how you offer potential content to communicators, the easier and less stressful your life will be! 


### 2. Execution
#### 2.1 Offer first
Since you'll be establishing these links early on, you're unlikely to have a big science story ready to go. Therefore you will need to make your worth to your collaborators clear in other ways - even if it's just saying that you're available for comments on related science stories. Many Journalists ask for quotes on social media these days, so follow journalists and look for opportunities to open a dialogue. 

**Note:** anyone looking to expand their professional social media presence should be aware of some of the pitfalls. A good initial safeguard is to draw a sharp distinction between your professional and private social media personas - different accounts for each is more-or-less essential. We encourage you to go to your organization's communications team for advice!

#### 2.2 Reciprocate and Engage
Once you've reached out, it's time to start developing the relationship. Look for opportunities to discuss your work, it can be surprisingly easy to build up some interest. At the same time, get involved with communication on a broader scale. Go to events outside your immediate field, more broader science conferences, networking events, and offer to speak at or get involved in Science Communication & Journalist postgraduate studies - they may be the people who will be your future contacts.

#### 2.3 Tailor your interactions
We've covered this topic in a lot more detail in the section on [Communicating Effectively](#Communicating-Effectively), so we will only quickly summarise here. Keep in mind the nature of your collaborators' work. How much prep time do they need to produce their content? How much time do they typically have available? In which format(s) do they usually work? What nature of content is best suited to their audience? Where possible, tailor your interactions to take these considerations into account.

#### 2.4 Be prepared to learn
Any interaction with someone whose expertise is outside of your own is an opportunity to develop your own skills. A point we have hit on again and again here is that these collaboration should be a meeting of equals, but it should also be an opportunity for knowledge transference. Working with you will help improve a communicator's science literacy, but equally your working with them will help you to better communicate. While the formats may be different, many of the skills involved in communicating scientific knowledge to our peers are identical to those involved in communicating it to the public, and one only needs to sit through a small number of dull conference talks to appreciate the value of engaging communication. Anything you pick up about how to best represent your work will pay dividends in other areas.


## To Whom to Talk
The list given below should serve as a jumping-off point from which to begin establishing links with communicators. It is by no means exhaustive and researchers should feel free to go beyond its limits or indeed bypass it entirely. However, it should serve to illustrate the breadth of communication platforms that can be leveraged for good science communication. 

### Internal
Most, if not all, companies and institutions will have dedicated teams for multiple different communication areas. As these will vary greatly from place to place we obviously cannot provide a concrete list. However, the following are general areas wherein potential communicators may be found.
- Public engagement teams
- industry trade body communications
- PAs to directorate
- [STEM Ambassadors](www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors)


### External
The field of science communication is wide, encompassing print media, both periodicals and books, online media, social media, film, broadcast television, online video, and meetups to name but a few. Below are just a few examples of potential avenues you may wish to pursue. 

Note that while we have included a specific examples of individual communicators and organisations, and links to their work, these will not necessarily be relevant to you. Rather, they offer an opportunity explore the broad spectrum of ongoing science communication work, and illustrate the breadth of different styles and media in which people can operate.
