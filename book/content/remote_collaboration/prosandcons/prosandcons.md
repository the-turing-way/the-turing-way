- Conflict resolution maybe difficult if most interactions happen in an allocated time slot.
- Sometimes such interactions may lack body language, or tone (online chat) and may lead to misunderstanding or unnecessary conflict.
- May lose the possibility of chanced interaction or water-cooler-effects and innovative ideas that they results.
- People will have different working condition, i.e. access to hardware, that can lead to wrong assumptions regarding replication of certain task
- May lead to distractions if working from a busy co-working space or home with not sufficient arrangement for work that can make it difficult for some people to focus and have disciplined work practices.
