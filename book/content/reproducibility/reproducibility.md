# What is reproducible science?

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
No previous knowledge needed.

## Summary
There are several definitions of reproducibility in use, and we discuss these in more detail in in the [definitions](03/definitions) section of this chapter.
_The Turing Way_ defines reproducibility as data and code being available to fully rerun the analysis.
This chapter will lay out why reproducibility is important for science and scientists, provide an overview of the most common definitions and define reproducibility for the context of this handbook.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
This chapter sets out the definition of reproducibility that the Turing Way project team used when writing this handbook.
It will be useful to avoid misunderstandings when reading the rest of the handbook.
