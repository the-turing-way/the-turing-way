# What are the values and rewards of doing reproducible science

Reporducible science:

**1. Democratises contribution**

- Equal opportunity to enhance your own work and improve others work
- Combine with Open Science (e.g. GitHub, Open Access journals - JOSS, GitHub, bioRxiv, etc.)
- Openly share your work on collaborative platforms (e.g. software, publications, events like hackathons)

**2. Helps gain fair acknowledgments/credits for your work**

- Contribute to improving others work while working on your own problems or building a new skill by working on project complete unrelated (see Chapetr). This is the best way to improve your visibility and strengthen your profile.
        
**3. Builds your reputation and profile**

- By making all the components of your work available you will facilitate higher number of citations, media attention, portfolio, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities). Well documented work means your work can easily be picked up and continued - either by others in your laboratory, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period.

**4. Advance your research**

- Putting in effort to make your research reproducible shows that you are a careful researcher and makes your research results more robust. All research outputs that are shared can be built upon more easily by others and in some cases, others following up on your work might lead to new collaborations.
