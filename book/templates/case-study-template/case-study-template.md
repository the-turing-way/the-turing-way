# Case Study Title

***Please remove all the Blockquotes (sentences that start with ">")***

> Each guide has a case studies chapter contains multiple case studies. 
> A case study should be a modular subchapter, but it can have more than one example.

**By Author 1, Author 2, ...**

> Try to keep your title short and concise.
> However, make sure it adequately reflects what the purpose of the case study is.

> You may use this space to tell readers who you are and what your role is.
> While not essential, doing so will help readers connect and engage with the content of your case study.

(sectioninitials-filename-overview)=
## Overview

> **Provide a high level overview of the subject of the case study.**
> Briefly introduce and describe the project, person, organisation, or phenomenon that your case study is about.
> If possible, describe the goals you set out to achieve in this case, highlighting any key player(s) and explaining what their roles were.
> Be sure to include relevant additional information (such as links and publication DOIs) about the subject of the case study. 


> In addition to _what_ your case study is about, you should also explain _why_ you are writing this case study and _how_ it may benefit the readers.
> When writing this section, think about why this topic is important to investigate and what your expected reader demographic is.
> As much as possible, relate the importance of your topic to the key concepts and overall message expressed in the Guide your case study belongs to.
> Some (non-exhaustive) concrete questions to consider include: 
> - Is the subject an unusual example of a research problem that requires more in-depth analysis?
> - Does the subject reveal more insight about a previously hidden problem? Does it go against prevailing assumptions in your research area?
> - Does the subject motivate a new research direction?
> - How did some of the key concepts in the Guide support the work done in this case?
> - Does the subject use key takeaways from _The Turing Way's_ recommendations in an interesting way?

(sectioninitials-filename-elements)=
## Elements of {Guide Name}

> Title this section appropriately depending on the Guide your case study is for.
> For example, if your case study is for the Guide for Collaboration, the title of this section should be `Elements of Collaboration`.
> Similarly, if your case study is for the Guide for Project Design, then the title of this section should be `Elements of Project Design`.

> **Highlight the main concepts from the Guide that are relevant to your case study.**
> For example, if your case study is for the Guide for Reproducible Research, you may want to briefly emphasise how Version Control was (or was not) integral for making your work reproducible.

> Ideally, each concept should be a chapter within the Guide your case study is for.
> When you mention a concept, remember to cross reference to the chapter where it is explained using _The Turing Way's_ [cross-referencing guidelines](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html).

> Use the rest of the section to take a deep dive into the individual concepts you introduced.

(sectioninitials-filename-elements-concept1)=
### Relevant Concept 1

> Replace the `concept1` portion of the label at the top of the header with a word (or acronym) that describes the concept you are focusing on in this section.
> If the key concept was Research Data Management, a good label could be `sectioninitials-filename-elements-rdm`. 

> Use this section to expatiate on the importance of the key concept in your case, explaining _how_ and _why_ it helped (or did not help).

> To drive home your point, you may also leverage images, external resources, code blocks, or other items you deem fit.
> Remember to refer to the [style guide](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style.html) for relevant recommendations as you write.

> **NOTE**: If your case study relied on several concepts expressed in the Guide, be sure to explain each one in its own section

(sectioninitials-filename-challenges)=
## Challenges

> **Use this section to discuss any challenges you faced while trying to use this Guide's recommendations in your case.**
> When writing, think about and express what specific recommendations you struggled with and why you struggled with them.
> What problems were you not able to solve? 
> How do you think it impacted the success of your case?
> What would you have done differently?

> If you overcame the challenges you highlighted (or learned how to overcome them), also describe the actions you took in detail.
> Remember that your recommendations here will be one of the key takeaways readers take from reading through your case study.

(sectioninitials-filename-reflections)=
## Reflections

> Use this section to express any new insights you gained and practiced in your case.
> As much as possible, try to tie your learnings to the Guide's overall message.
> For example, if you wrote your case study for the Guide for Reproducible Research, you may use this section to talk about anything new you learned about producing work that is reproducible.

> To help with writing this section, we have curated some questions to get you thinking.
> You can find the questions in the [reflection-questions.md](./reflection-questions.md) file.
> Please note that these questions are not exhaustive or definitive.
> You are encouraged to improve on them in a pull request.

> End your case study by highlighting the aspect of this case that you are the most proud of, and why.
> You may also wish to point your readers to other resources where they can learn more about your case or gain other relevant insights.

## BEFORE YOU GO

> - Use this template to create your case study.
> - Refrain from writing very long content as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, make your case studies as modular possible. You may even make them a series if necessary.
> - Have a look at the Style Guide and the Maintaining Consistency chapters to ensure that you have followed the relevant recommendations on
>   - Avoiding HTML
>   - Consecutive headers
>   - Labels and cross referencing
>   - Using images
>   - Latin abbreviations
>   - References and citations
>   - Title casing
>   - Matching headers with reference in table of content
