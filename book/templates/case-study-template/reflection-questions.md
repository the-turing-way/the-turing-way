# Reflection Questions

In this file, we have curated some reflection questions to give you ideas about what to think about as you write your case study reflections.

We believe it is important for readers to understand and appreciate your perspectives on the Guide (and its message) that your case study relates to.
These questions are designed to help you embed your perspectives within your case study.

The questions are categorised according to the different Guides in *The Turing Way*.
They are not exhaustive or definitive, and we encourage you to improve upon them in your Pull Requests.
Please read *The Turing Way’s* recommendations for contributing to the project in the [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
