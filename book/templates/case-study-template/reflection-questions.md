# Reflection Questions

In this file, we have curated some reflection questions to give you ideas on what to to think about as you write your case study reflections.

We believe that it is important for readers to understand and appreciate your perspectives about the Guide (and its message) your case study is for.
Thus, these questions are designed to help you embed your perspectives in your case study.


The questions are categorised into the different Guides in _The Turing Way_.
They are not exhaustive or definitive, and we encourage you to improve on them in your Pull Requests.
Please read _The Turing Way's_ recommendations for contributing to project in the [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
