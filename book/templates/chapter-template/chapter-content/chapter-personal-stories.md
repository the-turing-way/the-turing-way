# Personal Stories

***Please remove all the Blockquotes (sentences that start with ">")***

> A personal story is a case study about an individual who practices the main ideas from your chapter in their work.
> Personal stories should give readers a first-hand perspective and insight about how they may go about introducing your chapter's concepts in their own work.

> A personal story should be short, engaging, and have a clear call-to-action. 
> How you format it is up to you, however you may consider one of the following options:
> - An interview with the subject - for reference, see the [personal story](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-personal-stories.html) in the Version Control chapter
> - A blog-style article about the subject written from their perspective - for reference, see the [personal story](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-stories.html) in the Research Data Management Chapter.
> - A blog-style article written about the subject written from your perspective - in this case, it may be beneficial to include direct quotes from the subject in your article where possible. 

## `Subject Name`: `Story Caption`

> The title of the personal story should start with the name of the subject followed by a short caption that captures the overall message of the story.
> For example, the [personal story](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-stories.html) in the Research Data Management chapter is aptly titled: `Susanna-Assunta Sansone: From FAIR Co-Author to FAIR Doer`

> Regardless of how you choose to format the personal story, ensure that it contains the elements itemised in list below. 
> Use the items to structure your content but do not include them in your contribution. 
> Feel free to use images, external resources, or code blocks to tell a compelling story.
> Above all, centre the personal story around how readers are expected to benefit from the subject's experiences.

> ### Key Elements of a Personal Story
> - Introduce the subject, their role, what they are working on/have worked on, and provide links to their online activities and profiles (if the subject consents).
>   - An introduction will help readers connect and engage with the subject better
> - Describe how the subject is practicing your chapter's concepts in their work.

> - Communicate any thoughts or reflections the subject has about your chapter's topic.
