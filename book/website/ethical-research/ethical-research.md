# Guide for Ethical Research

***This guide covers topics related to ethical aspects in data science.***

Data scientists make data-driven decisions that require the collection of data and model building approaches that can have serious implications for health, security, politics, society and everything associated with them.
Researchers or any kind of stakeholders in data science have an obligation to consider the ethical standards and their impact of people's lives {cite}`Loyola2020Ethics`.

In this guide, we invite discussions and guidance on ethical considerations that a data scientist should keep in mind to ensure not only that their work maintains a high level of moral integrity, but also that their work is carried out at the highest scientific standards.

Check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved.
