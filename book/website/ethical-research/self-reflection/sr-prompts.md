# Self Reflection Prompts

Reflexivity is the process of using self-reflection to understand ourselves and our beliefs, and how these influence how we create knowledge through our work in data science. 
There are lots of different aspects you could consider, and the questions below are some prompts to help get you started. 

## Questions about my own identity 

- What is considered ethical in my culture that other cultures may see differently?
- What are my own {ref}`Social Graces<er-self-reflection-social-graces>`? 
- How have my Social Graces shaped my experiences of life? 
- How have my Social Graces shaped the decisions that have led me to do what I do now?
- What are the Social Graces of my family and friends? 
  - Are there Social Graces where we vary a lot/little?

## Questions about my research environment

- What are the shared values of my lab? My department? My university?
- Who is visibly present in my department? Who isn't?
    - What understanding do I have of why that is, and how have I formed this understanding?

## Questions about my relationship to my research topic

    - What evidence do I base those truths on? Who developed this evidence?
- Who do I most commonly cite in my research area, and how are their perspectives similar or different to mine?
