# Guerrilla Digital Preservation

[Management and preservation of data,
code and other artefacts](#rr-rdm) used for a research project is essential.
While there may be constraints on the time and other resources needed to do this,
under ideal circumstances there will not be a person or natural disaster actively working against you,
but not all research can take place in ideal circumstances.

In 1933, the library and archives of the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft were
[looted and ultimately burned][book burnings]
by members of the Deutsche Studentschaft and Sturmabteilung for being "un-German".
The first institute of its kind in the world,
the Institut conducted world-leading research into issues around gender and sexuality,
and its destruction set back women's and LGBTQ+ rights back decades:
no comparable dedicated research institute would exist
until the founding of [The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Institute) in 1947 [@strochlic2022greathunt].

In September 2018 the National Museum of Brazil's air conditioning [overheated due to a fault][NMBrazil],
resulting in a catastrophic fire and the destruction of approximately 92.5% of the Museum's 20 million-item archive.

In circumstances such as these,
working against an active adversary or the forces of nature,
it does not matter how well-established the institution preserving the material is.
While that institution provides an essential service,
it remains a single point of failure.

This section introduces several tools and technologies that can be used
to improve the resilience of archived research and resist attempts to censor scholarship.
[BitTorrent](#er-activism-digipres-p2p) enables the wide distribution of redundant copies of research materials using peer-to-peer file transfer.
[SciOp](#er-activism-digipres-sciop) and [AcademicTorrents](#er-activism-digipres-academictorrents)
are websites built to facilitate the discovery and distribution of such copies.

<!--
TODO: update this with links to digital preservation material once available
MAYBE: something about decentralisation vs federation vs centralisation
MAYBE: also include AcademicTorrents? IPFS?

## Peer-to-peer file sharing



[BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) is a network protocol
that enables peer-to-peer distribution of files.
It's associated in the popular consciousness with _illegal_ file sharing,
but its primary goal was, and remains, the distribution of _any_ digital content
