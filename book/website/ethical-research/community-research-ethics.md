# Introduction

Health research is carried out to improve lives and inform equitable public health decisions. However, the way this research is carried out either improves or exploits the people it seeks to serve. Community-centred health research ethics emphasizes the importance of involving communities not just as subjects but also as active partners in the research process.

This approach prioritises building trust, encouraging collaboration, ensuring that research benefits the community while minimising risks and burdens.

In this chapter, we will explore best practices for conducting ethical health research that centres the voices and needs of the communities involved. This includes involving community members at every stage of the research process: setting research priorities, designing the study and interpreting data and sharing resources.

Making research community-centred ensures that:
* Research questions reflect real community needs
* Study design and culturally and contextually appropriate
* Benefits of the research are shared study
* Trust is built and sustained

Institutional review boards  (IRBs) often focus on individual-level ethics, such as consent and confidentiality.  However, many studies have shown that this is not enough; most IRBs do not address community-level cultural risks, cultural context or power sharing. Shore et al. (2011)

## What makes research community-centred and ethical?

Community-centred health research  is guided by several principles that promote respect, fairness , and collaboration:

* Engaging communities in decision-making early and often
* Respect and adapt to the cultural context
* Involving communities in shaping the research process and data use.
* Ensuring  that the research  brings value to the community
* Sharing findings in clear and accessible formats

**Case Study: The Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project**

The Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP) is an example of community-centred research. It was developed in the Kahnawake Mohawk community near Montreal, Canada, in response to concerns about increasing rates of type 2 diabetes among children.

The project was designed and led in partnership with the community. A community advisory board helped shape the research goals, ensure cultural relevance and oversee implementation. The study focused on promoting healthy lifestyles through culturally adapted education programs in local schools. Decisions were made with academic researchers and community representatives. The community had a say in data collection, ownership and dissemination. Findings were shared back through community meetings, local newsletters, and adapted teaching materials.  This research became a model for indigenous health research, demonstrating how ethical, community-led research can have lasting positive impacts.

## Conclusion

Community-centred health research ethics is about doing research with communities, listening to them, respecting their knowledge and making sure the research benefits them. When researchers work more closely with communities, the research becomes more useful, fair and trustworthy. It helps build strong relationships and leads to better results that people can actually use.
