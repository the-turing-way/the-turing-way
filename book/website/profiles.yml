    Early Career Researchers (ECRs) are students, PhDs and early-stage postdocs
    who may not have a lot of experience in contributing to research projects
    from start to finish. This curated set of chapters will allow them to
    understand what best practices apply at different stages of development to
    ensure research reproducibility.

    For effective collaboration among international groups,
    such as in the Data Science Without Borders project,
    it is essential to learn, adopt, and implement best practices
    in open, reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science.
    These curated chapters will provide starting points, helping
    you navigate a broader set of practices in The Turing Way.
