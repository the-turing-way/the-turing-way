# Welcome

*Welcome to The Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.*

_The Turing Way_ is an open science, open collaboration, and community-driven project.
We involve and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone.
Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers, data scientists, software engineers, policymakers, and other practitioners in academia, industry, government and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

```{admonition} Top Tip
:class: tip
_The Turing Way_ is not meant to be read from start to finish.
Start with a concept, tool or method that you need now, in your current work.
Browse the different guides that make up the book, or use the search box to search for whatever you would like to learn about first.
```

All stakeholders from any level of experience or domain expertise are encouraged to use _The Turing Way_ to understand their roles and responsibility of reproducibility in data science and research.
You can inspect our resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way), contribute to the project as described in our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and re-use all materials ([see the License](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

In the {ref}`Foreword Section<fw>` of this book, we provide meta-level information about _The Turing Way_, including guidance on how to use and navigate this project, how to cite the book and opportunities to get involved.

## Our Community

_The Turing Way_ community is dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research "too easy not to do".
That means investing in the socio-technical skills required to work in a team, to build something more significant than any individual could deliver alone.

_The Turing Way_ is:

* a book
* a community
* a global collaboration

We hope you find the content in the book helpful.
Everything here is available for free under a [CC-BY licence](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
Please use and re-use whatever you need, for any purpose.

_The Turing Way_ receives support and funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), however, the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
We have contributions from across the UK, India, Mexico, Australia, the USA, some African countries, and many European countries.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members of research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.
We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and experiences can share their knowledge with others, together supporting each other in using data science to improve the world.

```{admonition} Translation
:class: tip
Call for translators! Weâ€™re looking for contributors to help translate this space for everyone! Read more about our translation workflow and how you can contribute to it in the {ref}`translation chapter<ch-translation>`.
```

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, everyone who participates in _The Turing Way_ project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

Learn more about our community members and community-level approaches in the {ref}`aw` of this book.
