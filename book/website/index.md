# Welcome

_Welcome to The Turing Way Handbook to Reproducible, Ethical, and Collaborative Data Science._

The Turing Way is an open science, open collaboration, and community-driven project. 
We involve and collaborate with a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and beneficial for everyone.

```{admonition} Top Tip
:class: tip
_The Turing Way_ is not meant to be read from start to finish. 
Start with what interests you!
Whether it's a concept, a tool, or a method you need right now, jump in.
Browse the different guides or use the search box —
it's all about what you want to learn.
```

Our moonshot goal is to make reproducibility "too easy not to do"! 
Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers, data scientists, software engineers, policymakers, and other practitioners in academia, industry, government and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.

The book is collaboratively written and built in the open from the start.
You can explore various opportunities to engage with the book or the broader community through this [start page](https://the-turing-way.start.page/).

## Different Pathways


(welcome-community)=
## Our Community

_The Turing Way_ community is dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research "too easy not to do".
That means investing in the socio-technical skills required to work in a team, to build something more significant than any individual could deliver alone.

_The Turing Way_ is:

* a book
* a community
* a global collaboration

We hope you find the content in the book helpful.
Everything here is available for free under a [CC-BY licence](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
Please use and re-use whatever you need, for any purpose.

_The Turing Way_ receives support and funding from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), however, the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
We have contributions from across the UK, India, Mexico, Australia, the USA, some African countries, and many European countries.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members of research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.
We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and experiences can share their knowledge with others, together supporting each other in using data science to improve the world.

```{admonition} Translation
:class: tip
Call for translators! We’re looking for contributors to help translate this space for everyone! Read more about our translation workflow and how you can contribute to it in the {ref}`translation chapter<ch-translation>`.
```

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, everyone who participates in _The Turing Way_ project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

Learn more about our community members and community-level approaches in the {ref}`aw` of this book.
