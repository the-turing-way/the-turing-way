[Mark Guzdial](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/why-should-we-teach-programming-hint-its-not-to-learn-problem-solving/){:target="_blank"} points out, there are actually many reasons to learn how to code/program:

- To understand our world.
- To study and understand processes.
- To be able to ask questions about the influences on their lives.
- To use an important new form of literacy.
- To have a new way to learn art, music, science, and mathematics.
- As a job skill.
- To use computers better.
- As a medium in which to learn problem-solving.
