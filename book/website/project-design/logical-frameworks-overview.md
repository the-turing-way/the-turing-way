## Summary

Logic models and logical frameworks are akin to the blueprints we use for planning and evaluating programmes aimed at social change. Picture them as the game plan for an initiative or organisation, outlining the goals and the means to achieve them. 

## Motivation

LogFrame helps in clearly defining the objectives and structure of a project. It ensures that all team members and stakeholders have a common understanding of what the project aims to achieve. It facilitates systematic planning by breaking down the project into manageable components such as inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and goals. This breakdown helps in identifying the necessary resources and actions required at each stage. It also help identifying potential risks and assumptions at the outset, LogFrame allows for proactive risk management. It helps in anticipating challenges and planning for contingencies, thus reducing the likelihood of project delays or failures.

In this chapter, we're going to explore the differences between Theory of Change and Logical Framework. It's akin to comparing a detailed map with a compass; both guide you, but in distinct ways. We'll explore how each model functions, what drives them, and where they might fall short. And to make it practical, we'll also include some templates to help you apply these models in real-life scenarios.
