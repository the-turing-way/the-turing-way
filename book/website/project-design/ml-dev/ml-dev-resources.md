Ensuring fairness and transparency in machine learning pipelines is essential for building trustworthy and ethical AI systems. By embedding these principles at each stage of the development process—from data setup to deployment—teams can design models that not only achieve high performance but also maintain equitable outcomes and accountability. This chapter outlined a fairness-oriented approach to machine learning project design, providing guidance on building reproducible, explainable, and unbiased models. As you apply these strategies, you’ll be better equipped to develop ML systems that align with both organizational goals and social responsibilities, promoting responsible AI practices in real-world applications.
