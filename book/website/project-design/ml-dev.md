## Summary

As machine learning (ML) continues to drive innovations across industries, ensuring that projects are designed with reproducibility, scalability, and fairness is critical. Poorly structured pipelines can lead to unreliable models, while a lack of governance can result in biased outcomes and non-replicable results. This chapter aims to guide you through the essential aspects of ML project design and governance, focusing on building reproducible workflows, designing robust pipelines, and embedding fairness throughout the entire project lifecycle. To ensure that your ML projects are not only reliable but also transparent and equitable, this chapter focused on the following characteristics:

- [ ] **Transparent and standardized recording:**  A critical aspect of reproducibility in machine learning projects is the transparent and standardized documentation of all steps in the process. This includes version control for overall processes (e.g. data selection, feature engineering, model training) and artefacts (e.g. datasets, model weights). Standardized recording formats for documentation can support cross disciplinary teams to review, reproduce, and audit at any time, improving both reliability and accountability.
- [ ] **Open for interdisciplinary communication:** Machine learning projects often involve stakeholders from different fields such as data science, engineering, domain experts, and business leaders. Using an accessible language, defining roles clearly, and providing interpretable outputs that non-technical team members can understand is essential for fair project management. Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that the ML system serves its intended purpose and addresses all necessary concerns, including ethical and operational considerations.
- [ ] **Clear motivation to infuse AI into the system:** Before integrating machine learning into a system, it is crucial to clearly define the reasons for doing so. This includes understanding the problem that AI will solve, setting measurable goals, and assessing the potential impact of the model on users and stakeholders. A well-defined motivation helps align the project with business objectives and social responsibilities while also allowing for more targeted evaluation metrics, ensuring that the AI system adds real value while maintaining fairness and minimizing unintended harm.
