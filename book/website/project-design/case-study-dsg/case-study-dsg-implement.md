# Implementation - Recruitment, Ethics & Impact

## Recruiting Talent 

The team needed to work on each project will vary from project to project. 
In most cases, a project will require a Principal Investigator (or similar role). 
They will likely be senior academics with expertise in the project area and experience leading on similar investigations. 
They will act as champions of the project and the sounding board for scientific ideas. 

A PI may be in place naturally from the start of the project, or they may need to be recruited as the project comes to fruition. 
For larger projects, a full-time research team may need to be recruited, for smaller projects support from PhD candidates may be more appropriate. 

# Data Access & Security 

It is essential that third party providers have confidence that their data will be handled appropriately with the necessary security measures, and equally that researchers are protected while working on the project. 
The data sensitivity or conditions of use for the data will dictate how it can be shared with researchers and how they can work on it. 

When assessing the dataâ€™s sensitivity, it is important to consider the project as a whole and wider uses of the data. 
For example data of publicly available satellite images might not seem sensitive, but if the project then seeks to extract a list of properties with specific features, this list could then become quite sensitive, especially if the occupants have not consented to their addresses being on such a list. 
Another example is a Twitter post, this is public and can be scraped by anyone, but if you were to then compile a list of users with certain political beliefs, this then becomes extremely sensitive information.

## Ethics Assessment 

In most academic institutions it is necessary for incoming projects to go through some kind of ethics application and approval process. 
Even if this is not a requirement, the ethics assessment principles should be applied to the project. 
The ethics application and approval process should be integrated into the thinking about the project, rather than administrative box-ticking. 
The ethics process is to be completed by the academics working on the project with scientific insight rather than research project managers.
Academics must collate the required information. 
If more information is required for a full ethics assessment, it is the responsibility of the academics to obtain this from collaborators. 

The core ethical questions to be considered are below, the function of each is to identify risks and inform how the research plans to minimise or eliminate those risks regarding:
* What are the ethical implications of the project?
* How was the data collected?
* How was consent obtained for collecting the data? 
* Will any issues of privacy & security arise from the project or resulting outputs?
* How does the project plan on keeping the data private & secure?

## Impact planning

It is important to consider what will happen post-project so that the work doesn't end up in the drawer. 
This should be done as the project is being designed as it might influence the tools used. 
Start with the end in mind so that when the project finishes, plans are in place to do it justice ensuring findings will be put to meaningful use. 

Channels for ensuring longevity might include:

### Planning 
* Could the work be undertaken for a bigger follow-up project? 
* If so, who might this be relevant to, are there relevant research groups or academics that could be approached? 

### Publishing
* Can the work be published after the project is complete? 
* If the project contains sensitive information and data, can a version be published that omits the sensitive information? 

This will maximise impact on the scientific research community. 
But be careful that redaction does not alter the overall narrative, a consideration, one should take at the project proposal stage.

### Exposure

How will the work be published to reach the widest audience, are there relevant newsletters or bulletins that it could be included in? Or social media groups that the work could be shared via?

### Formatting

If the work or code can be shared, could the format be designed so that it is a compatible as possible with a wide audience? 
For example, by using widely used and accessible tools rather than specific paid versions.
