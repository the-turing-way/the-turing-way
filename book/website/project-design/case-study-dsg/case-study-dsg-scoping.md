# Scoping - Initial Proposal 

## Initial Considerations 

A great research question doesn’t always equate to a great project.
Therefore, the following aspects of the initial proposal must be considered at the conception stage of research.
This will allow different stakeholders to assess the feasibility of the project and design the roadmap effectively. 

### Project documentation

* Define the research objectives and consider if they are possible to achieve.
* Explore and share if similar projects have taken place before, and why this piece of research is necessary (for example, examining a new or novel aspect). 
* Describe the data used for this project, how this data is collected, how permission will be obtained to use it, and how it will be wrangled in preparation for the research.
* Transparently communicate how sensitive information will be handled, stored and accessed to ensure it remains secure.
* Propose what analysis methods have been suggested by different stakeholders and what subsequent research resources will be required to support the project.
* Share the timeline - what milestones exist and when the project will be concluded to ensure that all the hard work doesn’t end up in the draw.

### Stakeholders

* Identify people or teams who will be involved in preparing, conducting & presenting findings. 
* If all collaborators are not in place already, describe how they will be recruited.
* Justify how these stakeholders are right for the job, and if other existing groups with specific skillset should be invited to collaborate or consulted before work begins.

### Motivation

Describe the motivation behind carrying out this project by answering to following questions:

* What will the impact be to the immediate stakeholders of the project? 
* What is the impact to the research community as a result of this work being undertaken?
* What are the possible benefits and negatives to the wider society of the work being undertaken? 
* What are the ethical implications of the project and how can these be mitigated against.

## Idea to Proposal 

When an idea is first conceived, it is unlikely to arrive as a perfectly formed research question, it will likely enter a scoping phase which will tease out a sensible and feasible version of the question and sub-questions.  
For example, if the key question is fairly general or wide-reaching, it will need to be broken down into sub-questions that can then be tackled empirically. 
The data proposed might then not be suitable to answer the adjusted question and so re-framing might be necessary so that the data remains expected to answer the question. 

## The Initial Proposal 

The project proposal (or a similar document) is one of the first items that will be produced. 
This will likely be used to pitch the project to collaborators and funders and to generally spread the word of its conception to stakeholders and the research community.  
An initial review of the data should take place before the proposal is written, to identify obvious issues, if there are major issues these should be addressed, or at least mitigation plans defined before the proposal is finalised. 

The initial proposal does not need to be perfect and should be considered a document for iteration. 
The proposal should map out key elements of the project as much as is possible at the time of writing. 
The exercise of writing the proposal will likely reveal gaps and that is ok!

The project proposal will likely be written by the scientific researchers involved in the project, with peer review encouraged. 
It's not expected that the full team will be in place by this stage and the proposal may well be used to attract talent to the project.  
Equally the project partner could have authorship and in the context of Data Study Groups, it is the organisation proposing the project that writes the project proposal. 
In such cases, we advise that the proposal is subject to academic review.  

Concretely a data science project proposal should include: 

* **Project description** and the challenge it seeks to solve. 
* **Background information** on why this project is necessary, what problem it aims to solve and how solving this challenge can be beneficial. 
* *Main challenges or approaches** that are considered and known approaches that have been tried before to solve them.
* **Information available** for the scientific solutions and data used in the project.
 It might be useful to include details on each dataset, such as data inventory, size, variable descriptions, data collection mechanism and level of data sensitivity.
For confidential data, it is crucial to describe how permission will be obtained to use this data.
* **Data handling** approaches, any known issues of working with data of this kind and how those issues will be mitigated.
* Project impact: 
* **Stakeholders** including direct users, wider society and research community as well as the expected impact of the project.
* **Follow up work** including the channels for communication, feedback and the intended use of any findings.
