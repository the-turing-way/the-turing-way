# Persona Creation Tool

Persona development for a project or community is a great way for recognising who the stakeholders of that project are, why they would associate with the project, what their needs are and how those needs could be met.
Persona creation tools can allow team members to collaborate efficiently with each other, develop a common understanding of their target audience and bring design principles into their work while ultimately creating an empathetic pathway for engagement.

In this chapter, we provide a simple step by step guide that one can use for creating different personas for their communities and projects.
Your project-specific personas will then be useful in enhancing the pathways your members take to engage with your project, examples for which has been provided in the next subchapter.

## Step-by-step guide for building a persona

### Section 1: Name and Role

Start by giving your persona a real name and real role with the help of some assumed professional skills.
This will help you anchor them in reality.
You can use the random name generator website [behindthename.com](https://www.behindthename.com/random/) to create diverse names.

## Putting this together in a persona canvas

The persona canvas can be used to assemble all your responses in one place, share this tangible information of your mental model (abstract concepts from our thoughts) with your colleagues and create a common language to communicate about your community members, users, and contributors.

The [https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools](https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools) have created multiple persona canvases (one is shown in the figure above) which are available for reuse under CC-BY ShareAlike 4.0 License, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools/tools/persona-canvas).

## Examples of personas in _The Turing Way_ community

In the next subchapter, you will find examples of personas and pathways in _The Turing Way_ community.
With the help of different personas, we have also collected a list of contribution pathways in _The Turing Way_ and how they are acknowledged (see {ref}`Contribution types and pathways <ch-acknowledgement-examples>`).

*You are welcome to contribute to this chapter by testing the process described here to create a persona for your project.
Your feedback will help us improve this process, and your output can be added here under the example section.*
