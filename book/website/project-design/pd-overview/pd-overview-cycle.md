# Project Cycle

The success of any project relies on effective management and a clear project cycle. In this chapter, we’ll walk through the main phases of the project cycle, from initiation to closure, highlighting the essential steps in each stage. For researchers, programmers, and practitioners, following a structured approach to project management helps you get the best results and make good use of your resources.

## Initiation

The initiation phase sets the stage for the project by defining its purpose, scope, and objectives. If you rush this stage, you risk undermining the project’s outcomes. Here are some key parts of project initiation:

- **Project Charter**: This document describes the project’s vision, objectives, stakeholders, and main deliverables. It acts as a reference point for decisions throughout the project. You can find a [Project Charter Template on Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/project-charter-templates-and-guidelines-every-business-need?srsltid=AfmBOorD2-FX1O7z5HiFoWzOezc772oUUEJjE3PSliHYTuuH1dWDAueF) or here [https://github.com/pm4id/project-charter-template](https://github.com/pm4id/project-charter-template).

- **Contracts**: Drawing up contracts with all relevant parties clarifies roles, responsibilities, and expectations. These agreements might involve collaborators, industry partners, universities, vendors, or others.

- **Governance**: A governance framework gives structure to decision-making, risk management, and stakeholder involvement. This helps keep the project on track and supports compliance with any relevant rules or regulations.

## Planning

During the planning phase, you define project activities, set out deliverables, allocate resources, and create a roadmap for delivery. Key elements include:

- **Risk Register**: This tool helps you spot potential risks and decide how to handle them. By keeping a risk register up to date, your team can deal with problems before they become serious. See a [risk register template from the University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/corporate-information/risk-register-template-and-guidance).

- **IP Register**: An intellectual property (IP) register records any IP matters, such as copyrights, patents, or licences linked to the project. This helps you keep track of IP rights and manage them properly.

- **Delivery Plans and Milestones**: These set out the project timeline, key milestones, and deliverables. They help you track progress and keep the team moving in the right direction. A Gantt chart is a popular way to visualise this.

- **Logic Models**: Logic models (or logical frameworks) act as blueprints for planning and evaluating projects with long-term goals, such as social change. Find out more at [enhancing Program performance with Logic Models from the University of Wisconsin](https://logicmodel.extension.wisc.edu/).

## Execution

The execution phase is when you put your plan into action and manage day-to-day activities. Important aspects include:

- **Project Boards**: These groups oversee the project during execution. They usually include key stakeholders who review progress, give feedback, and make important decisions. A [RACI matrix](https://www.racichart.org/) (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is a handy tool for clarifying roles.

- **Budgets**: This involves keeping an eye on project spending, making sure resources are used wisely, and making changes if needed.

(pd-overview-cycle-monitoring)=
## Monitoring

Monitoring is all about tracking project performance, spotting any issues, and making adjustments as you go. Key components include:

- **Reporting**: Regular updates help the team share progress, risks, and issues with stakeholders. This keeps everyone informed and supports good decision-making.

- **Forecasts**: Forecasting means predicting future expenses, outcomes based on current progress and data. This helps the team anticipate challenges and plan for what’s ahead. 

(pd-overview-cycle-everywhere)=
## Everywhere

Throughout every stage of the project cycle, it’s important to spot and address problems as soon as they arise. This includes resolving issues quickly, managing disagreements, and keeping communication open so that the project stays on track.

(pd-overview-cycle-closing)=
## Closing

The closing phase is about wrapping up the project, capturing lessons learned, and handing over outcomes. Key elements include:

- **Project Legacy**: Writing up the project legacy means that knowledge, deliverables, and best practices are recorded and shared with the wider research community. This supports continuous improvement and helps future projects build on your work.
