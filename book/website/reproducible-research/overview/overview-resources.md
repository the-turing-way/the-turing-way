## What to Learn Next?
{ref}`rr-open` would be a good chapter to read next.
If you want to start learning hands-on practices, we recommend reading the {ref}`rr-vcs` chapter next.

### Using the command line

While most of what this book is about does not require the use of the command line, it often actually makes things easier. 
Writing commands in the terminal, PowerShell, command-line, or command prompt provides an alternative means of interacting with the computer.
It offers several advantages and can be considered a beneficial approach for various reasons, including efficiency, independence on graphical user interfaces, flexibility, automation of tasks.
Often, advanced tasks or options are only available as command line tools (for example advanced git, datalad. 
You first need to know that linux and OSX use `bash` code natively, while the command line in windows uses `batch script`, which is a different language. 

List of some tools and training materials for using the command-line:
- A [game to teach one the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD, UNIX) terminal](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) 
- Carpentries lesson on [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- An article on [Command Line Tutorial: Usage in Linux and macOS](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/)
- A lesson on [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash)

Some nice-to-know tips:

- When working on the terminal please make sure that you are in the correct folder (also called as directory):
  - If you right click folders, you may have a function to open a terminal there
  - use `cd ..` to go in the parent folder (`cd` is to move into folders, `..` means up)
  - you can also type `cd ` (note the space) and then drag and drop a folder. This action would autocomplete the folder's path into the terminal.

- The superpower developers use all the time and will never think you do not know about it: use the tab on your keyboard to get automatic text completion.
