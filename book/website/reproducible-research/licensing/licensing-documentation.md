# Licensing Documentation

Licenses accompanying documentation clarify how accompanying materials can be used, copied, or shared.
These licenses can be applied to standalone documentation or in combination with licenses associated with other kinds of artefacts.

For example, *The Turing Way* uses two licenses, one for documentation (Creative Commons) and another for code (MIT).
You can find details in the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)) located in the main GitHub repository.

## Creative Commons Licenses for Documentation

Licenses for documentation allow making information available to users with defined conditions (or limitations) for copying, reuse, redistribution, and modification.
[Creative Commons (CC)](https://creativecommons.org/) is the most widely used license for text, images, audio, and video.

To help determine which Creative Commons License is right for you, Creative Commons organisation offer a comprehensive [set of documentation](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) and a [chooser to get started in a few steps](https://creativecommons.org/choose).

```{note}

CC licenses give everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law. From the reuser’s perspective, the presence of a Creative Commons license on a copyrighted work answers the question, "What can I do with this work?"

CC licenses are legal tools that creators and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public while reserving other rights.
Those who want to make their work available to the public for limited kinds of uses while preserving their copyright may want to consider using CC licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their rights under copyright law should not use CC licenses.

There are six different license types, listed from most to least permissive nature (illustrated in the image below):

1. **CC 0** allows you to copy and publish, does not require attribution, allows commercial use, allows you to modify and adapt, and allows you to change the license.
2. **CC BY** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, allows commercial use, allows you to modify and adapt, and allows you to change the license.
3. **CC BY Share-Alike (SA)** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, allows commercial use, and allows you to modify and adapt, but does not allow you to change the license.
* **CC BY Non-Disclosure (ND)** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, allows commercial use, does not allow you to modify and adapt, and allows you to change the license.
* **CC BY Non-Commercial (NC)** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, does not allow commercial use, allows you to modify and adapt, and allows you to change the license.
* **CC BY Non-Commercial Share-Alike (NC SA)** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, does not allow commercial use, allows you to modify and adapt, and does not allow you to change the license.
* **CC BY Non-Commercial Non-Disclosure (NC ND)** allows you to copy and publish, requires attribution, does not allow commercial use, does not allow you to modify and adapt, and allows you to change the license.

The six licenses and the public domain dedication tool give creators a range of options.
The best way to decide which is appropriate for you is to think about why you want to share your work, and how you hope others will use that work.

The [Creative Commons License Chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) is a good place to assess which type of license is a good fit for your work.
