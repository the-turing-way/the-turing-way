# Checklist

This is a checklist for adding a license to your project repository.

- Go to your repository folder (local computer or online repository on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket)
- Create a new file and name is `License.txt` or `License.md` based on your  preference of the file format
- Choose a type of license (or multiple license for mixed content) that is suitable for your project (visit [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/))
- Copy the license content to the newly created file, for example, you can use an Open Source license [CC-BY 4.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/) for text content and [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) for software
- Save your file and add details in your `README.md` file
