# Preregsistration process 

## Overview

## Preregsistration vs registered report


## Platforms

There are several platforms where you can submit your preregistration or Registered Report, from openly accessible registries to discipline-specific 
journals and micropublishing platforms.

* **For micropublishing:** [Octopus](https://www.octopus.ac/) 

* **Journals:** Currently, over 300 journals accept submissions of Registered Reports. A useful list is available [on COS - Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports).

* **General repositories:**
  * [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - online open repository for all scholarship, enabling researchers from all disciplines to share and preserve their research outputs through a DOI, regardless of size or format.
  * [FigShare](https://figshare.com/) - online open access repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs through a DOI, including figures, datasets, images, and videos.
 
The table below, provided by the [UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN)](https://ukrn.github.io/), gives a good overview of online templates available 
for preregistration in open research registries, tailored to specific disciplines and types of study.
