# Qualitative preregistration process

## Overview
>  Preregistration is now common in quantitative research, yet its use in qualitative studies has only recently gained attention.
This chapter explains why qualitative researchers, including those conducting longitudinal and exploratory work, should consider preregistering their study design.
We briefly outline what qualitative research entails and then discuss preregistration — addressing common criticisms and highlighting its benefits.
Preregistration enhances transparency, encourages reflexivity, and strengthens credibility without compromising the flexibility of qualitative inquiry.
It promotes more deliberate study planning and supports greater openness, reproducibility and dialogue within the qualitative research community.
The chapter ends by illustrating the process using the Open Science Framework (OSF) template for qualitative preregistration. 

## What is qualitative research?

Qualitative research is primarily concerned with exploring the how, why, and what of human experiences and attitudes. 
It does so through the collection of non-numerical data (such as words, images, sounds) often relying on interviews, focus groups or observation to gather insights and uncover participants' lived perspectives (Haven & Van Grootel, 2019). 
This approach is particularly valuable for investigating new or poorly understood phenomena and for generating or refining theoretical models that require rich, detailed data (Hurley, 1999). 
It provides deep understanding of the processes underlying observed patterns and relationships and offers nuanced descriptions of the phenomena studied. Rather than being constrained by rigid structures, qualitative research designs are typically flexible and emergent. 
This flexibility may appear to some quantitatively oriented fields as a weakness, but it actually represents a strength that enhances the rigour and credibility of the research. 

The degree of subjectivity and exploration varies depending on whether a study adopts an inductive (exploratory, when there is no theory to test), deductive (testing existing theories or hypotheses against empirical data), or abductive approach (combining the two, testing theories while remaining open to new insights).

Qualitative research emphasises the inherently interpretive role of the researcher, who does not act as a detached observer. 
Findings are not objective truths, but interpretations shaped by the researcher’s perspective and the subjective nature of the inquiry itself.

## Preregistration for qualitative studies: why?

While preregistration has become increasingly common in quantitative research, particularly experimental studies, its implementation and understanding within qualitative research have only recently started to receive attention. 
As discussed in the chapter [Why Write a Registered Report](#cm-dif-articles-registered-reports), preregistration promotes best practices by encouraging researchers to define their research questions, methods, and analysis plans in advance, distinguishing findings that arise from prediction from those that emerge through postdiction (Nosek et al., 2018). 
Because preregistration was originally designed to test specific hypotheses prior to analysis, some scholars criticise its application to qualitative research. 
They argue that it may constrain the inherently exploratory and interpretive nature of qualitative inquiry, and that preregistration’s structured approach can appear too rigid to accommodate the evolving character of qualitative designs (Weinberger & Yam, 2025).

Nonetheless, preregistration in qualitative research is gaining recognition, and for good reason. 
Although objectivity is not the aim of qualitative inquiry, every researcher operates within a philosophical and theoretical framework that shapes interpretation (Haven & Van Grootel, 2019). 
Preregistration provides an opportunity to make these assumptions explicit before data collection begins, fostering reflexivity regarding positionality, values and beliefs, and reducing the risk of bias or overly subjective interpretation. 
Importantly, preregistration doesn’t mean your design is unchangeable. 
Researchers may make changes, if they justify them transparently. 
During analysis and write-up, then, preregistration serves both as a useful reference point to aid memory (Stewart et al., 2020) (particularly valuable given the flexible nature of qualitative work) and as a mechanism for accountability and research integrity. 
By documenting decisions and justifying methodological adjustments, preregistration supports key criteria of qualitative rigour such as credibility, process dependability and confirmability, while still preserving flexibility. 

Above all, preregistration encourages more deliberate study planning, leading to designs that are accurate, well-documented and reproducible (Stewart et al., 2020). 
Although reproducibility remains a challenge in qualitative research, preregistration can help by enhancing transparency and fostering dialogue within the qualitative community. 
It promotes collaboration through inviting feedback and comments before data collection, helping to move towards a system of open science.

## How do you write a qualitative pre-registration report?

For qualitative research, the **Open Science Framework (OSF)** provides a [clear, easy-to-follow template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vLoRAs6RmXKy0v1RCx6osSaYk4r64Hgl6S4_KtWbeM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fwbi14d4b65g) that guides researchers through each step of creating a concise study plan.  
When using this template, we recommend completing it offline first and then copying and pasting your responses into the online form, although OSF also allows you to save your preregistration as a draft while making edits before submission. 
Once the completed form is submitted on OSF, a time-stamped record of the document is created. 
Researchers can choose to make their preregistration public immediately or after an embargo period. 
In the latter case, once the study is concluded and results are submitted to a journal, the preregistration link should be shared with reviewers to verify that the final study followed the preregistered plan. 
 
The preregistration will be approved, and either made public or placed under embargo, once all admin contributors have approved the submission, or 48 hours have passed (whichever comes first). 
If any admin contributor rejects the registration, the submission will be cancelled and returned as a draft.
This process applies to all preregistrations on OSF, although specific details may vary depending on the chosen template. [Full guidance is available here](https://help.osf.io/article/330-welcome-to-registrations).
