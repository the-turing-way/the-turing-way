- Enable auto formatting in your editor by tweaking the preferences/settings.
- Type `Ctrl + s` (windows, linux) or `âŒ˜ + s` (mac) to save the work to format the code.

### For static code analysis

- Build the project to enable `linters` to spot the errors/warnings in the code (if any).
- Make relevant changes and repeat the above step.
- {ref}`Commit and push<rr-vcs-git-commit>` the changes to remote **Github/GitLab/BitBucket** repository to run the pre-deployment tests.

### For robust code

- Find assumptions in your program, and make them explicit.
- Write if/else statements to test your assumptions.
