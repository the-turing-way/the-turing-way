## Summary

Scientific results and evidence are strengthened if those results can be replicated and confirmed by several independent researchers (see {ref}`definitions <rr-overview-definitions>`).

When researchers employ transparency in their research - in other words, when they properly document and share the data and processes associated with their analyses - the broader research community is able to save valuable time when reproducing or building upon published results. 
Often, data or code from prior projects will be re-used by new researchers to verify old findings or develop new analyses. 

Learn about some of the other benefits of reproducible research in the {ref}`Added Advantages <rr-overview-benefits>` subchapter.

Major media outlets have [reported on](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/attempt-to-replicate-major-social-scientific-findings-of-past-decade-fails) investigations showing that a significant percentage of scientific studies cannot be reproduced. This leads to other academics and society losing trust in scientific results {cite:ps}`baker2016reproducibility`. 

In addition, "negative results" can be published easily, helping avoid other researchers wasting time repeating analyses that will not return the expected results {cite:ps}`Dirnagl2010bias`.
