# Research data management toolkits

## What is a research data management toolkit?

A research data management toolkit provides information and advice about the data management activities in the whole data lifecycle. As such, it provides researchers with a strategy to manage their data to international standards.

Next to a website based around the research data management lifecycle, a research data management toolkit may also include "real world" use cases and scenarios. Additionally, a collection of tools to support the researcher may be available in a number of toolkits.


## Why should you use a research data management toolkit?

A research data management toolkit will help you to maximize the efficiency and integrity of your research, and to increase your visibility and impact. Consulting a research data management toolkit will also learn you how to comply with requirements from funders, publishers and others. Last but not least, the toolkit can assist in finding and re-using datasets for your own research.


## How to choose a research data management toolkit?

Information and materials are often sorted by topic and audience. Materials can be found relevant to your role (researcher, research support, IT specialist), your research domain (for life sciences: plant phenotyping, human data,...) or your problem (such as storage, data transfer).  


A wide variety of research data management toolkits are available. Here, we list a number of toolkits:

* [JISC research data management toolkit](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/rdm-toolkit)
* [ELIXIR research data management toolkit](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/index.html)
* [University of New Hampshire data management toolkit](https://libraryguides.unh.edu/datamanagement)

*Many more toolkits are available: lots of them are rather guides than toolkits. One could argue about the definition of a RDM toolkit*
