# Checklist
Below follow two checklists, one for individual researchers and one for research teams:

# Individual Researcher Checklist

- Do not touch the raw data. 
Back it up somewhere reasonable and keep a read-only copy (see {ref}`Data Storage and Organisation<rr-rdm-storage>`).

- Set up a {ref}`Data Management Plan<rr-rdm-dmp>` to decide how the data is managed. 
This is especially relevant if you collect {ref}`sensitive data<pd-sdp>` and need to plan for consent for sharing!

- Document everything and keep the documentation with the data (see {ref}`Documentation and Metadata<rr-rdm-metadata>`) to ensure your data is reusable. 

- Try not to re-invent the wheel. 
Before you start creating a new schema, storage format or naming protocol, try to find an existing tool: have a (quick) internet search or ask your colleagues (see {ref}`Documentation and Metadata<rr-rdm-metadata>`).  

Something that is already being used is likely to be better in the long run.

- Follow any procedures required by your research group, institute, or country (ethics, integrity codes, policies on data management/open science)

# Research Team Checklist: 
This list is based on [Borghi and van Gulick 2022](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.9497f68e) {cite:ps}`Borghi2022checklist`.

Discuss the checklist with your team!
  
- Every member of the research team is able to find and use the data, code, documentation and other materials related to this project (project's research materials).
    - We will continue to do so ten years from now.
    - Our documentation is maintained and reviewed regularly. 
    - The documentation describes the data management practices of the project and includes roles and responsibilities of individual team members      
- We have established on/off boarding procedures.
- Another researcher from outside the research group but in the same field would be able to find and use the project's research materials.
- We have a standardised set of data management practices, including file naming conventions and folder structures (see {ref}`Data Storage and Organisation<rr-rdm-storage>`).
- The data is stored and backed up on recommended data storage systems.
- We reviewed all applicable policies (institution, funder, potential publisher).
- We have read through and understand other relevant agreements, licenses, or other requirements.
- We have sought out community standards and best practices related to our data.
- We have set up a {ref}`Data Management Plan<rr-rdm-dmp>` to help us decide what research objects will be made publicly available.
