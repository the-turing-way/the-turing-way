# Checklist
Below follow two checklists, one for individual researchers and one for research teams:

# Individual Researcher Checklist

- Do not touch the raw data. 
Back it up somewhere reasonable and keep a read-only copy.

- Have a plan! 
Decide where your data is going to be stored, what it is called, when/if it needs to be deleted before you start collecting it and note it down in a {ref}`Data Management Plan<rr-rdm-dmp>`. 
If you collect {ref}`sensitive data<pd-sdp>`, plan for consent for sharing from the start!

- Document everything. 
You know who the worst person at replying to emails is about what the sampling frequency of channel X was. 
Nope not them, it's actually yourself from a year ago. 
Keep the documentation with the data!

- Create the data you want to see in the world. 
Imagine someone was about to give you a dataset that you needed to analyse well in order to get that job you have been dreaming about. 
What would you want it to look like? That is how yours should look.

- Try not to re-invent the wheel. 
Before you start creating a new schema, storage format or naming protocol, have a quick google or ask your colleagues. 
Something that is already being used is likely to be better in the long run.

# Research Team Checklist: 
This list is based on [Borghi and van Gulick 2022](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.9497f68e) {cite:ps}`Borghi2022checklist`.

Discuss the checklist with your team!
  
- Every member of the research team is able to find and use the data, code, documentation and other materials related to this project (project's research materials).
    - We will continue to do so ten years from now.
    - Our documentation is maintained and reviewed regularly. 
    - The documentation describes the data management practices of the project and includes roles and responsibilities of individual team members      
- We have established on/off boarding procedures.
- Another researcher from outside the research group but in the same field would be able to find and use the project's research materials.
- We have a standardised set of data management practices, including file naming conventions and folder structures (see {ref}`Data Storage and Organisation<rr-rdm-storage>`.
- The data is stored and backed up on recommended data storage systems.
- We reviewed all applicable policies (institution, funder, potential publisher).
- We have read through and understand other relevant agreements, licenses, or other requirements.
- We have sought out community standards and best practices related to our data.
- We have set up a {ref}`Data Management Plan<rr-rdm-dmp>` to help us decide what research objects will be made publicly available.
