For a more practical overview on tools and practises that facilitate reproducibility, please see the [Sensitive Data chapters](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdp.html) on [managing](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpm.html) and [working on](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpw.html) sensitive data under the [Guide for Project Design](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-design.html#pd).

## Personal data

Personal data is information about **living people** who can be identified using the data that you are processing, either directly or indirectly (for example, a person's name, address or other unique identifier such as their Social Security number). 
Find out more about what personal data is and what policies apply to this type of data in the {ref}`personal data section<pd-sdp-personal>`.

## Informed consent

Informed, voluntary and fair consent to participate in a study is very important for any research project that involves human participants. You can find more information about this in the {ref}`Informed Consent section<pd-sdpm-informed>`.


(rr-rdm-privacy)=
## Safeguard privacy
There are a number of strategies that you can adopt to **safeguard the privacy** of your research subjects, which are described in detail in the {ref}`Data Privacy Strategies section<pd-sdpm-privacy>`. If you do plan to share or publish the data you should ensure that this can be done so safely: read the {ref}`Sharing Sensitive Data section<pd-sdpm-sharing>`
