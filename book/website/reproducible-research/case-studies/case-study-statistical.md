# A Statistical Methods Manuscript

## About this case study

The purpose of this case study is to discuss the different components of
research reproducibility implemented in designing and conducting a
statistical study.
With the help of their manuscript, the authors provide a catalog of methods
used in their research and cross-reference them to the respective
sections discussed in this {ref}`rr`.

## About the Manuscript

- **Title:** A review of Bayesian perspectives on sample size derivation
for confirmatory trials.{cite}`Kunzmann2020CS`
- **Authors:** Kevin Kunzmann, Michael J. Grayling, Kim May Lee,
David S. Robertson, Kaspar Rufibach, James M. S. Wason
- **Publication month & year**: June 2020

### Overview

The manuscript{cite}`Kunzmann2020CS` itself is concerned with the problem of
deriving a suitable sample size for a clinical trial.
This is a classical problem in statistics and particularly important in
medical statistics where collecting trial data is extremely expensive and
ethical considerations need to be addressed.
The manuscript reviews and extends methods to systematically incorporate
planning uncertainty into the sample size derivation.

## Catalog of different methods for reproducible research

### Version control

The git repository
[https://github.com/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty](https://github.com/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty)
contains all code required to produce the manuscript
[arXiv:2006.15715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15715)
from scratch.
For an in-depth explanation of the importance of version control for
reproducible research, see {ref}`Version Control Systems<rr-vcs>`.


### Research data management

In this particular case,
{ref}`data management <rr-rdm>` aspects are not an issue since the
manuscript is exclusively based on hypothetical examples and no
external, protected data is required.


#### Literate programming

The manuscript{cite}`Kunzmann2020CS` itself is written in and built with
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
The source files are contained in the subfolder `latex/`.
Plain TeX files were preferred over literate programming solutions like
[knitr](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) for [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
to facilitate the use of dedicated LaTeX editors like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project).
This means, however, that all figures used in the manuscript need to be
created separately.
A dedicated [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
`notebooks/figures-for-manuscript.ipynb` combining code and rudimentary
descriptions are provided to that end.


### Reproducible software environment

Although this means that all code required to compile the manuscript from scratch
is available in a self-contained environment,
it is not yet sufficient for ensuring reproducibility.
Installing LaTeX, Jupyter, and R with the same specification
needed to run all code can still be challenging for less experienced users.
To avoid this from keeping interested readers from experimenting with the code,
a combination of the Python package
[repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker) and a free
[BinderHub](https://mybinder.org/) hosting service is used.
For details on these techniques, see the chapter on {ref}`BinderHub<rr-binderhub>`.
This allows interested individuals to start an interactive version of the
repository with all required software preinstalled - in exactly the right
versions!
Note that it is possible to provide *version stable* binder links

This badge points to the state of the repository at a specific point in time (via
the git tagging feature).
This means that the links will remain valid and unchanged even if there are
later corrections to the contents of the repository!
Binder supports multiple user interfaces.
This is leveraged to provide and Jupyter lab Integrated Development Environment
view on the repository to explore file, the Jupyter notebook, or to open a shell for
further commands.
The second badge directly opens an interactive Shiny app that illustrates
some of the points discussed in the manuscript and requires no familiarity with
programming at all.
All relevant configurations for Binder are located in the subfolder `.binder`.


### Workflow management using Snakemake

Since JupyterLab also allows to open a shell in the repository instance opened
using a Binder link,
another feature of the repository can be used to reproduce the *entire manuscript from scratch*.
The Python workflow manager [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
was used to define all required steps in a `Snakefile`.
To execute this workflow,
you can open a shell in the [online version of JupyterHub](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty/0.2.1?urlpath=shiny/apps/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty/).
Once the user interface finished loading, open a new terminal and type
```
snakemake -F --cores 1  manuscript
```
This will execute all the required steps in turn:

1. create all plots by executing the Jupyter notebook file
2. compiling the actual `latex/main.pdf` file from the LaTeX sources

You should then see a `main.pdf` file in the `latex` subfolder.


### Support for local instantiation of the software environment

The Python package repo2docker can also be used locally to reproduce the
same computing environment.
To this end, you will need to have Python and Docker installed.
For details on Docker and container technologies in general,
please see the chapter on {ref}`reproducible environments and containers<rr-renv-containers>`.
Then simply clone the repository on your local machine using the commands
```
git clone git@github.com:kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty.git
cd sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty
```
After cloning the repository,
you can build and run a Docker container locally using the configuration files
provided in the `.binder/` folder using the following command
```
jupyter-repo2docker -E .
```
The container is started automatically after the build completes and you can
use the usual Jupyter interface in your browser
by following the link printed by repo2docker
to explore the repository locally.


### Use of continuous integration

Although not necessary for the reproducibility of this manuscript,
the repository also makes use of continuous integration ({ref}`CI <rr-ci>`)
using [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
GitHub actions are similar in spirit to {ref}`rr-ci-travis` but the runners are
provided directly from GitHub.

The repository defines two workflows in `.github/workflows` directory.
The first one, [`.github/workflows/build_and_run.yml`](https://github.com/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_run.yml),
is activated whenever the master branch of the repository is updated and the specifications in `.binder` are changed.
This builds the container, pushes it to a public container repository [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty), and then checks that the Snakemake workflow runs through without problems.
The second one, [`.github/workflows/run.yml`](https://github.com/kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty/blob/master/.github/workflows/run.yml),
runs when the folder `.binder` was not changed and uses the pre-built
Docker container to run the Snakemake workflow.
The latter saves a lot of computing time since the computational
environment will change much less often than the contents of the repository.
The use of CI thus facilitates checking contributions by pull requests for
technical integrity and makes the respective latest version of the required container
available for direct download.
This means that instead of building the container locally using repo2docker you could thus just
download it directly and execute the workflow using the following commands
```
docker run -d --name mycontainer kkmann/sample-size-calculation-under-uncertainty
docker exec --name mycontainer /
    snakemake -F --cores 1  manuscript
```

### Long term archiving and citability

The GitHub repository is also linked with [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/) to ensure long-term
archiving, see {ref}`cm-citable-cite-software`

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3899943.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3899943)

Note that a DOI provided by Zenodo can also be used with BinderHub to turn a
repository snapshot backed up on Zenodo in an interactive environment
([see this blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/binder-with-zenodo-af68ed6648a6)).
