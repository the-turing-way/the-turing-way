## Prerequisites

The following sections in this handbook provide useful context and complementary information to this chapter:

## Summary

Research Data Management (RDM) [{term}`def<Research Data Management>`] covers how research data can be stored, described and reused.
Data here is used as a generic term to encompass all digital objects.
RDM is a vital part of enabling reproducible research.
RDM ensures efficiency in research workflows, and also greater reach and impact, as data become {ref}`FAIR <rr-rdm-fair>` (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).
Data should be stored in multiple locations and backed-up regularly to prevent loss or data corruption.
Clearly describing data using documentation and metadata ensures that others know how to access, use and reuse your data, and also enable conditions for sharing and publishing data to be outlined.

  A blue and grey scale cartoon.
  Private data is shown as an underground reservoir of water under a well with an open padlock representing access to that data.
  Above the well a person with a ponytail says confidentiality and consent indicating the mechanisms by which the private data can be accessed.
  A pipeline fountain is spurting 1s and 0s forming a cloud labelled public data, which is raining 1s and 0s onto a field of bar chats and pie charts being tended by people, indicating the provement of public knowledge and scientific progress through public data.
  A wheelbarrow of pie charts labelled public benefit at the front of the image reinforces this idea.

- {ref}`Managing your data <rr-rdm-storage-organisation>` allows you to always find your data and ensure the quality of scientific practice.
- {ref}`Storing your data properly <rr-rdm-storage>` and backing-up regularly prevents data loss.
- It can help with {ref}`recognition <cm-citable-orcid>` for all research outputs.
- It stimulates **collaboration** with others, who will find it easier to {ref}`understand and reuse your data <rr-rdm-metadata>`.
- RDM is cost/time efficient (see [Why Does Data Need to be Managed?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7RZ2t3Cpig)), especially if {ref}`shared publicly <rr-rdm-sharing>`, as you will always be able to find and use your data.
