# Open Science Framework (OSF) 

<!-- Note: OSF is also mentioned in Organising a Conference chapter -->
*The OSF is a free open-source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research.* https://help.osf.io/article/342-getting-started-on-the-osf  
OSF is way more than a data repository or an archive; it is a collaboration tool which can be used by research teams to work on projects privately or openly, similar to Github. 
This case study highlights OSF as one of the  repositories *for everything* that you can choose to store your research output long term and make it citable through getting a persitent identifier. 
<!-- OSF enables connections and integration to other tools that researchers already use, streamlining their process. <!-- we have a cool case study on this from Emma but this one is for another time-->
OSF helps to control levels of access you want to give to different people. 
This can be achieved through OSF folder structure that allows to assign different privacy settings to different folders within one project. 
In OSF terminology, these folders with custom privacy settings are called *components*.
The following functionality of OSF helps to make such a folder Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR):
   -  In addition to its own unique, persistent URLs, OSF offers DOIs for public folders; thus it's possible to assign a Persistent Identifier to your project or its subfolder.
  - OSF allows to add metadata to your folder. Project metadata fields include at Title, Description, License, Tags and Persitent Identifiers. It's possible to add more metadata into the project Wiki or submit in form of a separate file.
  - It's possible to add license to a project to specify how others are allowed to copy, distribute, and make use of this work. 
  - OSF provides deatiled landing pages to document projects. Each *component* has its own wiki that allows to add reach documnetaiton on multiple levels.
 - File formats are not limited by OSF; it's your decision which format to use to make your project future proof. 
 
OSF can help you comply with the GDPR, if you process data of European citizens. Under the GDPR, storing data of European citizens outside of the EU/EEA is considered an international data transfer, which introduces complications to data sharing. It has  servers  in Europe, and it allows you to choose where you would like your data to be stored.
