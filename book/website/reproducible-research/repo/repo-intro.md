# Introduction to repositories

A repository is a place where digital objects can be stored and shared with others (see also [this repository definition](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/glossary.html#term-Repository)).

Selecting an appropriate repository for your research outputs has many benefits:
- it helps make your research outputs Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR). This is achieved through:
    - repositories assigning a Persistent Identifier to your digital object. The most commonly used persistent identifiers for research objects is the Digital Object Identifier, usually abbreviated to DOI.
    - using a metadata standard to consistently describe your digital object. Note that using a disciplinary repository (i.e. a repository for your specific discipline) is the most likely to provide a metadata standard that can handle your research objects best. There are examples of what that means later in the chapter.
    - allowing you to easily add a usage licence, which describes to potential reusers of your work what they are allowed to do with it. Have a look at the [Licensing chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing.html) and subchpapters for a thorough discussion of software and data licensing.
    - providing landing pages to document projects. These can be in the form of READMEs, wikis, or other and they provide a space to give a high-level description of your project and why it might be relevant to people.
    - widely-used file formats. Many repositories have restrictions on the file formats used to store digital objects. They do this to ensure the sustainability of research objects, as some file formats (especially proprietary ones with a limited user base) can become deprecated.
- it helps you choose the levels of access you want to give to different people. As covered in [Barriers to Data Sharing](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html#barriers-to-data-sharing), there are good reasons to not to make all your research outputs completely open. However, it's still useful to put your digital objects in a repository and make the metadata public, but only allow people to access those digital objects if they have certain credentials or if they have been given explicit access. That way, your work will still be findable (because the metadata are public) and secure (because you can control who has access).
- it helps you comply with the GDPR, if you process data of European citizens. Under the GDPR, storing data of European citizens outside of the EU/EEA is considered an international data transfer, which introduces complications to data sharing. There are many repositories that either have servers only in Europe, or in multiple locations in the world and allow you to choose where you would like your data to be stored.
