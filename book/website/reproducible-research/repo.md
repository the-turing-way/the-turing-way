(sectioninitials-filename-motivation)=
## Motivation
Data should be submitted to domain or discipline specific, community recognised repository where possible, or to a general purpose or multidisciplinary repository if no suitable discipline specific repository is available. Discipline specific data repositories are likely to have more functionalities for the type of data that you would like to share, as well as community standards that you can adhere to to make the data more FAIR (link to FAIR principles). Why sharing data is a good idea is covered in other places in these guides, e.g. [Motivations for sharing and archiving data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html?highlight=repository#motivations-for-sharing-data) and [Open data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html#open-data).
