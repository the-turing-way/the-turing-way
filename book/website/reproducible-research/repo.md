## Motivation

Why sharing data is a good idea is covered in other places in these guides, e.g. [Motivations for sharing and archiving data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html?highlight=repository#motivations-for-sharing-data) and [Open data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html#open-data).

After making the decision to share data, or other research outputs, another decision needs to be made: *where* to share those research outputs. This chapter outlines some od the crucial functionalities that you should look out for when picking where to share your data, code, slides, or any other research output.
