# Enhancing Reproducibility in Low-Resource Settings

Scientific research is the foundation for innovations in health, technology, and environmental sustainability, yet its reliability hinges on one critical factor: reproducibility.
Reproducibility, the ability to obtain consistent results under identical conditions, validates the credibility of scientific findings and ensures that discoveries can be trusted, built upon, and applied effectively in real-world contexts. 

However, the ability to conduct reproducible research is not evenly distributed globally, and researchers in low-resource settings such as in the Global Majority face unique challenges that impede their capacity to achieve reproducibility.
For example, despite notable scientific contributions from African researchers, their work is often hindered by limited access to essential resources, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of institutional support for best practices in reproducibility.
These challenges not only affect individual researchers but also restrict the global visibility and integration of African research outputs.
As a result, reproducibility in scientific research across Africa remains an urgent yet complex issue that demands targeted, innovative solutions.

This chapter addresses the specific reproducibility barriers encountered in low-resource settings, particularly in African countries and offers practical strategies to overcome these obstacles. 
The aim is to provide actionable insights and recommendations that help researchers conduct rigorous, transparent, and reproducible research, even when resources are limited.

## Why Reproducibility Matters for Low-Resource Settings: An African Perspective

Enhancing reproducibility is not only essential for the credibility of science in low-resource settings but also for empowering African researchers to contribute solutions to local and global challenges.
Reliable research findings have the potential to inform policy, improve public health, and advance technology that addresses the unique needs of African communities.
Furthermore, improving reproducibility fosters a culture of transparency and trust in scientific research, supporting Africa's growing reputation as a source of high-quality, impactful science.

Investing in reproducibility within African and other low-resource research environments is thus an investment in sustainable, locally-led innovation.
As African researchers increasingly take the lead in addressing region-specific challenges such as infectious disease, climate adaptation, and food security, building a strong foundation in reproducible research practices will ensure that the findings are credible and impactful.


## Key Challenges in Reproducibility

In many low-resource settings, researchers face formidable obstacles to achieving reproducibility, including:

1. **Inadequate Access to Infrastructure and Technology:**
* Scientific reproducibility often requires advanced tools, from high-performance computing resources to reliable internet access and laboratory equipment.
For researchers in low-resource settings, these resources are frequently unavailable, inaccessible, or prohibitively expensive.
* Without sufficient access to technology for data storage, analysis, and sharing, researchers struggle to follow standardised reproducibility practices.
2. **Limited Funding and Institutional Support:**
* Funding constraints are a significant barrier, as limited budgets often cannot cover essential resources such as open-access publishing fees, software licenses, and/or data-sharing platforms. 
This makes it challenging for researchers to adhere to best practices in data management and open science, both crucial for reproducibility.
* Many institutions in low-resource settings lack dedicated policies or infrastructure for reproducible research, leaving researchers without guidance or institutional support for conducting transparent and repeatable studies.
3. **Knowledge and Training Gaps:**
* Reproducible research requires specialised skills in data management, statistical analysis, and the use of open science tools such as version control software. 
However, researchers in low-resource settings often lack access to relevant training opportunities, hindering their ability to implement reproducibility best practices.
* Language barriers and a scarcity of locally relevant training materials further complicate reproducibility education and skill development.
4. **Data Sharing and Access Limitations:**
* Sharing open data is essential for reproducibility, as it allows other researchers to validate results, replicate studies, and build on prior work. 
However, obstacles like limited internet connectivity, digital storage constraints, restricted access to secure data repositories, and a lack of trust around data sharing often prevent researchers in low-resource settings from sharing their data effectively.
5. **Visibility Challenges:**
* Researchers in low-resource settings frequently experience challenges in gaining global visibility for their work, for example, when researchers may not have the ability to pay publishing fees to journals or participate in international conferences. 
This may reduce collaborative opportunities and access to funding. This disconnect limits their ability to engage in international reproducibility initiatives and hinders their contributions to the broader scientific community.


## Strategies for Overcoming Reproducibility Challenges in Low-Resource Settings

Overcoming reproducibility challenges in low-resource settings requires a multi-layered approach that addresses:

1. capacity-building,
2. technology accessibility,
3. collaborative networking, and
4. supportive institutional policies.

Each of these components is crucial for empowering researchers to produce reliable and transparent science, particularly where resource constraints can hinder reproducibility efforts.

The foundation of this approach lies in building the capacity of researchers through tailored training programs.
Many researchers in low-resource settings may lack access to advanced training in reproducible research practices, making workshops and seminars on topics like data management, open science, and version control essential.

Collaborations with local universities, research institutes, and even global organisations can enable these training sessions, while online courses and open educational resources (OERs) offer affordable learning alternatives.
To ensure that knowledge is widely distributed, train-the-trainer initiatives could create a network of local experts who can then pass on reproducibility skills within their institutions and regions.

Affordable and open-access tools are another critical aspect of improving reproducibility. Researchers can use open-source software like R, Python, and JASP for data analysis, along with platforms like GitHub or Gitlab for version control. 
These tools offer the capabilities of proprietary software without the financial burden usually associated with computational tools.

Likewise, using online data repositories such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) or Zenodo helps researchers adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, ensuring their data can be accessed, shared, and reused in future research. 
Implementing these tools not only facilitates reproducibility but also fosters a culture of transparency and open science within the scientific community.

Collaboration and mentorship are also essential. 
Building regional reproducibility networks where researchers can share resources, best practices, and experiences offers a form of collective problem-solving that can help alleviate common barriers.
Online communities on platforms like Slack and ResearchGate can serve as virtual spaces for discussion and support, while mentorship programs that pair researchers in low-resource settings with experienced mentors provide guidance on complex issues like grant writing, project management, and reproducibility standards. 
Through these relationships, researchers can benefit from a sense of community, both within Africa and globally.

Institutional and policy support form a backbone for sustainability. 
Developing institutional guidelines that standardise data sharing, open science, and transparent reporting, such as in African universities and research centres, can create a research culture that values and prioritises reproducibility.
Local institutions could also consider policies that recognise or even incentivise researchers who embrace reproducible practices.
Supporting open-access publishing is another key step, as open access enables researchers to share their findings more broadly and make their work accessible to a wider audience, helping to bridge global disparities in information sharing.

Finally, fostering a culture of open science is central to reproducibility.
Encouraging data-sharing practices that adhere to FAIR principles allows research to be easily found, accessed, and reused by others.
Open documentation and code sharing, using platforms like GitHub, Zenodo, or protocols.io, makes it easier for researchers to verify and replicate each other's work, providing transparency that strengthens trust in scientific findings.
Raising awareness of the benefits of reproducibility—such as increased research impact, credibility, and opportunities for collaboration—can shift attitudes towards openness and accountability in research.

Addressing the challenges of reproducibility in low-resource settings, like in Africa, through these strategies ultimately creates a stronger, more interconnected research community. 
With enhanced training, accessible tools, supportive networks, and clear policies, researchers can produce science that stands up to scrutiny and contributes to a global body of knowledge that values and upholds the integrity of reproducible research.
