# Case Studies: Reproducible Research

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level

This chapter assumes familiarity with several topics covered in this {ref}`rr`.
Since not all examples will demonstrate the use of the same combinations of methods covered in this guide, the prerequisite and skill level will vary across the case studies.
Therefore, we recommend the authors to indicate those skills for each case study separately.

## Summary

In this chapter, a selection of case studies is presented that can be used to
see how reproducible research methods are used in practice and applied across fields.
If you think that you might have an example to contribute yourself, feel free

## Motivation and Background

Learning by example can be an effective way to learn new concepts.
Maybe you can start your personal project by adapting one of the examples
to your needs?
