## What is a framework?

In website development, a framework is a set of pre-written code, tools, and
libraries that help developers build and maintain websites more efficiently.
Frameworks provide a structured foundation, offering reusable code modules,
common design patterns, and guidelines, which help streamline the development
process and promote best practices. They essentially "frame" the development by
managing basic functionalities and allowing developers to focus on the unique
aspects of their projects rather than repetitive tasks.

## Benefits of using a framework

Frameworks provide several benefits in website development:

* **Code Reusability**: Common functions are built-in, which
reduces redundancy.
* **Efficiency**: They allow faster development by eliminating the need
to code every component from scratch.
* **Scalability**: Frameworks provide a solid structure that can grow with the
website.
* **Security**: Many frameworks come with built-in security features and
updates, which help mitigate vulnerabilities.
