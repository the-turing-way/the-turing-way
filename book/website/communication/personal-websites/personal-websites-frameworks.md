# Frameworks

## What is a framework?

In website development, a framework is a set of pre-written code, tools, and libraries that help developers build and maintain websites more efficiently.
Frameworks provide a structured foundation, offering reusable code modules, common design patterns, and guidelines, which help streamline the development process and promote best practices.

## Benefits of using a framework

Frameworks provide several benefits for website development:

* **Code Reusability**: Common functions are built-in, which reduces redundancy.
* **Efficiency**: They allow faster development by eliminating the need to code every component from scratch.
* **Scalability**: Frameworks provide a solid structure that can grow with the website.
* **Security**: Many frameworks come with built-in security features and updates, which help mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Popular frameworks

Some of the commonly used frameworks are mentioned below.
These have been divided into two categories, depending upon whether a person wants to create a website using low-code or high-code options.

### No-Code/Low-Code frameworks

#### What is no-code/low-code?

Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) refers to a set of development approaches that allow users to build applications and software solutions with minimal to no coding knowledge. These platforms leverage visual interfaces, drag-and-drop components, and pre-built templates, making it accessible for users who aren't skilled in programming.

  * Use GitHub repository [beautify my GitHub](<https://github.com/rzashakeri/beautify-github-profile>), to customize your GH profile.

### Pro-code/High-Code frameworks

#### What is pro-code/high-code?

Pro-Code (or High-Code) development refers to traditional software development approaches where applications are built primarily through hand-coding by skilled developers, using programming languages and frameworks without relying on visual builders or drag-and-drop components. This approach allows for maximum flexibility, customization, and control over different aspects of the application.
