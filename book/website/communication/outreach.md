# Outreach in Data Science and Research

Outreach is an umbrella term for a broad range of activities which engage researchers with audiences external to the core research team, including other scientists, the general public, journalists, investors and policy makers.
Outreach can provide major benefits to both researchers and society, from enhancing the visibility of your work to developing public understanding of science.
However, as with all research activities, outreach requires careful planning and resourcing, so that researchers can share a collective responsibility to combat the spread of misinformation and provide the public with an accurate representation of science.
While outreach activities are diverse in scope, we believe that all high quality outreach is underpinned by a set of shared underlying principles.

This chapter provides a set of guidelines and best practices for data science outreach.
One of the main goals of this chapter is to discuss the importance of outreach in the research cycle, both in the academia and industry, and this way change the general consensus of outreach from 'optional' to 'essential' activity.

- In the subchapter, {ref}`Motivation and Background<cm-outreach-motivation>`, you will learn about best practices for outreach and communication to ensure that our research has a broader impact.
