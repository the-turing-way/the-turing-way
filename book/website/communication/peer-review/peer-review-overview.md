# Peer Review Types

## Types of Peer Review
​
Peer review is a critical component of advancing research. Peer review can be done on many different research outputs, including:
* manuscripts 
* software (including code, documentation, and examples)
* datasets
* communication and presentation materials


Peer review can be formal or informal and ideally occurs at different levels throughout a project. When most people think of peer review they think of this in the context of reviewing a journal article.
Journal articles, as opposed to {ref}`preprints<rr-open-access-preprints>`, have gone through the peer review process- the paper has been peer reviewed and modified by the author in response to the reviewer's suggestions, so these papers are seen to have added value. 
However, there are also initiatives to peer review preprints, for example, [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org/) arranges reviews for manuscripts. You can read more about preprints in the {ref}`Open Access<rr-open-access>` chapter.


## Levels of Peer Review
* *Step 1* - Peer review often happens informally among team members.
Feedback helps improve your project, on its way to being shared with the broader community.​
* *Step 2* - The project is going well, but it needs input from the broader community to reach it's full potential.
This stage is often where the formal peer review process happens, but in an open project this level of feedback is often provided throughout.​
* *Step 3* - By incorporating everyone's ideas, the project unites the community and perceives feedback as a way to improve projects rather than as a competitive process.

We see peer review as an important exercise in {ref}`collaboration<cl>` not limited to a quality-safeguard procedure.
However, in current research practice, peer review often appears as a hurdle everyone needs to pass through.

  Recommendations on Addressing reviewer comments by www.phdcomics.com, copyrighted by Jorge Cham (2005).
  The recommendations only contain text and have three examples of reviewer comments.
  On top of the examples is written: bad reviews on your paper?
  Follow these guidelines and you may yet get it past the editor/
  Reviewer comment 1: The method/device/paradigm the authors propose is clearly wrong.
  How not to respond: Yes, we know. We thought we could still get a paper out of it. Sorry.
  Correct Response: The reviewer raises and interesting concern. However, as the focus of this work is exploratory and not performance-based, validation was not foudn to be of critical importance to the contribution of the paper.
  Reviewer comment 2: The authors fail to reference the work of Smith et al who solved the same problem 20 years ago.
  How not to respond: Huh. We didn't think anybody had read that. Actually, their solution is better than ours.
  Correct response: The reviewer raises an interesting concern. However, our work is based on completely different first principles (we use different variable names), and has much more attractive graphical user interface.
  Reviewer comment 3: This paper is poorly written and scientifically unsound. I do not recommend it for publication.
  How not to respond: You #$% reviewer! I know who you are! I'm gonna get you when it is my turn to review!
  Correct response: The reviewer raises an interesting concern. However, we feel the reviewer did not fully comprehend the scope of the work, and misjudged the results based on incorrect assumptions.
