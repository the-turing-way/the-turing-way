# Narrative/Evidenced based CVs
The 'narrative' or 'evidenced based' CV format provides a structured written description of a person’s contributions and achievements to research. 
Compared to traditional academic CVs, narrative CVs reflect a broad range of relevant skills and experiences. 
As there is no ideal type of researcher and evidence-based CVs allow you to highlight your own academic profile without being limited by a small range of questions and criteria.  

(cm-personal-narrative-cv-motivation)=
## Motivation

Traditional academic CVs have focused primarily on the quantity rather than the quality of research contributions. 
By focusing on a narrow range of metrics based on publications and obtainal of grants, traditional CVs do not capture the full range of research activities.
Traditional CVs also don't allow an explanation of how researchers have overcome barriers and how they embraced opportunities. 

In contrast, narrative CVs place more focus on how the activities you undertook strengthened your skills or were important for your career stage, and the rationale for undertaking those activities.

The evidenced-based CV also aligns with initiatives focussing on improving the way research is evaluated, such as San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment ([DORA](https://sfdora.org/read/)) and Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment ([CoARA](https://coara.eu/)).

## Narrative CV Templates

There are many versions of a narrative CV. 
Below you can find examples that some research funders use: 
* [Résumé for Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/develop-your-application/resume-for-research-and-innovation-r4ri-guidance/) (R4RI)
* [Evidenced-based CV](https://www.nwo.nl/en/evidence-based-cv) (NWO)
* [Swiss National Science Foundation CV](https://www.snf.ch/en/gKcnwW6aEft4bMPF/page/your-curriculum-vitae-all-about-the-cv-format) (SNSF)
* [BioSketch](https://grants.nih.gov/grants-process/write-application/forms-directory/biosketch#biosketch-) (NIH)

It is important to check which template you need to follow, what restrictions are in place (such as word count or mentions of gender/names) and whether there is available guidance or example CVs. 

(cm-personal-narrative-cv-overview)=
## Overview

Evidenced-based CVs generally consist of two sections: the academic profile and the key outputs.

### Academic profile

- Who are you as a researcher? 
- What are your most relevant qualities and academic achievements? 
- What is your vision and focus, and how does this reflect in your work? 
How is your vision/work relevant to the call?
- How have you used opportunities (such grants)?
- Are there other circumstances that should be taken into account? 
Generally there is a section in the narrative CV where you can indicate any career breaks, unconventional career paths or other contributions to the research community. 
This provides context for the evaluation relative to the career stage you are in. 
Focus on how these circumstances have affected your career, do not go into details of the circumstances themselves.
 
### Key outputs 

Generally, a maximum of 10 key outputs are described in this section. 
Here we describe how to describe these outputs, give examples and end with a list of types of outputs you may consider.

- Motivation why this key output is selected, focusing on knowledge advancement and recent achievements. 
Emphasise the resulting change or benefit (who were the beneficiaries, were benefits social/economic/environmental/health/cultural?).
- Focus on your strongest contributions and those that are most relevant for the call you are applying for. 
- Description of your contribution to the key output (for example, via [CRediT Contributor Roles Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/)).
- Focus on quality over quantity. 
What evidence shows that this work is of high quality and/or that it is relevant to the proposed project?
- Describe the importance of your key output to the community and your career. 
- Focus on what you have achieved, not on what you are planning to do in the future. 
- Describe outcomes, and how you enabled them, rather than just stating activities. 
How have you successfully carried out the project?

## How to structure sentences and paragraphs 

The information in this section has been summarized based on @oxford2023narrative.

1. Summary sentence: start with the main message that you want a reviewer to notice.
2. Short descriptions of your strongest contributions: what you did and why it is important, with evidence. 
3. Sentence summarising additional contributions: end with a brief mention of other activities or contributions that you do not have space to describe fully but you feel are important for this funding application.

:sync: Example 1
Example: I carried out the data integration using [method A] and co-wrote an early analysis of the effects of [B and C] on health outcomes [DOI]. This study (cited XXX times since X year) was the basis of a series of research community workshops, organised by [organisation D], which led to a [funder] award for the [E] consortium (£ amount).

Example: I have supervised/line-managed/mentored [numbers of students, staff roles] who went on to [example achievements of supervisees and mentees]. I supported their development through [examples of specific ways you supported development, such as providing opportunities (through sponsorship, resources, sharing of contacts, offering roles with responsibilities) for learning skill A or experiencing B].

:sync: Example 5
Example: In [year], I co-organised the first stakeholder engagement day in the UK (XX attendees) for [public interest topic A], which included a panel discussion at which campaigners spoke about their experiences and break-out groups discussed research priorities. Evidence submitted as part of public consultation led to changes in local policy, leading to [XX%] decline in the effect of [A] on the affected population group.

### Tips

- To reference a publication, use a digital object identifier ([DOI](#cm-citable-steps-doi) hyperlinked to the publication. 
Only include full citations if requested by the funder to save space.
- For a team project, mention your specific contributions and the skills that you used or developed. 
- Describe how this research advanced the field. 
- Demonstrate your commitment to open and transparent research practices, including in how you manage and share data, methods, and findings.
- Go beyond a list of the numbers of people you have supervised or mentored. 
For example, how did you help them to develop and what did they go on to achieve? 
- What was the scale and profile of a team you have led and how was your leadership important for the achievements of the team?
Even if you didn’t have a leadership role, how did you contribute to the success of a team or the development of others? 
- Did you overcome any challenges in collaborations or partnerships? 
How did you contribute to helping collaborations to succeed? 
- Have you taken steps to be inclusive in your approach to managing or mentoring? 
If so, explain how you have done so. 
- Don’t overwhelm reviewers with long lists, or dilute the communication of your key achievements.
