# Competency Profiles and Professional Standards

### What is a competency?
To effectively identify learners' needs, educators should have access to and utilize specific competency profiles and professional standards relevant to their field of instruction. A competency is a combination of skills, knowledge, and behaviors/attitudes that an individual must have to perform a specific job or task effectively. It encompasses not only technical abilities and expertise but also personal attributes such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Competencies are often used in educational contexts to assess and develop individuals' abilities to meet specific standards or achieve particular goals.
Here is an example of knowledge, skills, and behavior in the context of teaching data science in higher education:
- **Knowledge**: Understanding advanced data science concepts and methodologies.
   - Example: A data science educator has in-depth knowledge of machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques, which they use to inform their curriculum and lectures.
- **Skills**: The ability to effectively teach and apply data science techniques.
   - Example: The educator skilfully designs and conducts hands-on projects and coding labs, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets using programming languages like Python and tools like Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Behaviour/Attitude**: Demonstrating professional and ethical behaviour in an educational setting.
   - Example: The educator shows a commitment to academic integrity by promoting ethical data usage, encouraging collaboration over competition, and providing constructive feedback to support student development.

### Key aspects of the competency-based approach
A competency-based approach for educators focuses on ensuring that both teaching and learning are centered around clearly defined competenciesâ€”specific skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students need to master. This approach emphasizes the outcomes of the learning process rather than the traditional time-based methods.

Please read more about the key aspects of competency-based approach:



#### Focus on Outcomes
Emphasising the desired outcomes or competencies that learners must achieve, rather than the time spent in a course or the specific content covered.

#### Personalization and Flexibility
Allowing learners to progress at their own pace, based on their individual needs and prior knowledge. In addition, offering flexibility in how learning occurs, which can include online, in-person, or hybrid models, and recognizing prior learning and experiences.

#### Continuous Improvement
Encouraging ongoing reflection and adaptation of the educational program based on feedback and assessment data to ensure it meets the evolving needs of learners and the industry.

#### Relevance to Real-World Applications
Ensuring that competencies are aligned with real-world skills and requirements, making the education directly applicable to professional and practical scenarios.

#### Clear Competency Definitions and Assessments
Establishing well-defined and measurable competencies that specify the skills, knowledge, and behaviours required. Also, using various assessment methods to evaluate whether learners have achieved the defined competencies, often requiring the demonstration of skills through practical applications or projects which can be collected in a portfolio.


### Competency Frameworks and Accreditation 
Competency frameworks for educators are structured outlines that define the skills, knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes educators need to perform their roles effectively. These frameworks provide clear expectations and benchmarks for professional development, instructional practice, and career progression. In the following we describe the T-shaped competency framework and give details about professionalization and accreditation in Data Science education.
#### T-Shaped Competency Framework
A T-shaped competency refers to a model for skills and expertise characterised by two dimensions: 
1. **Depth of Knowledge (the vertical bar of the "T")**:
   - This represents deep expertise and proficiency in a specific area or discipline. It indicates a strong foundation and advanced skills in a particular field, allowing the individual to be highly competent and specialised in that domain.

2. **Breadth of Knowledge (the horizontal bar of the "T")**:
   - This represents a wide range of knowledge across multiple disciplines or areas. It indicates the ability to collaborate across different fields, understand various perspectives, and apply knowledge from other areas to their specialised field.

In a nutshell, T-shaped competencies describe professionals who possess deep expertise in one area while also having broad knowledge across other areas, making them versatile and effective in collaborative and interdisciplinary environments. This model is particularly valued in domains that require innovation, teamwork, and adaptability like data science.

#### Professionalization and Accreditation of Data Science
Accreditations for educators vary depending on the country and the specific area of education. The general aim of accreditations is to ensure that educators, whether individual teachers or educational institutions, meet established standards of quality and effectiveness. 


In the data science and AI domain, there are several accreditation and professionalization bodies serving various purposes. Due to the rapid growth and evolution of these fields, multiple bodies ensure that certifications and standards keep pace with technological advancements. Additionally, data science and AI find diverse applications across industries like healthcare, finance, and marketing, prompting different accreditation bodies to cater to specific needs and standards within these sectors. Moreover, accreditation bodies play a crucial role in standardizing skills and knowledge, ensuring that certified professionals meet predetermined levels of competency and adhere to best practices. Furthermore, different regions and countries may have their own accrediting bodies to maintain local standards and practices, thereby promoting global recognition and mobility. Certification and accreditation also provide a pathway for continuous professional development, enabling individuals to stay abreast of new tools, techniques, and industry standards. Employers value certifications from recognized bodies as they instill confidence in the skills and knowledge of their employees, aiding in recruitment and career advancement. Finally, ethical standards in data science and AI are paramount, and accreditation bodies contribute to establishing and enforcing ethical guidelines within the profession. Examples of professional accreditation bodies are:

## Summary
Understanding the needs of learners is fundamental to designing effective learning products. Insights from various educators are compiled in this chapter to help create learning personas and tailor content accordingly. When designing learning products, a strong focus should be on user experience (UX) principles. The initial step involves thorough research to identify key topics, relevant questions, and metrics for success. Plans should be presented to experts for feedback and refined based on their input.

Designing with empathy requires understanding the perspectives and challenges of learners. It is crucial to avoid assumptions and be open to diverse perspectives to deconstruct biases. Ensuring inclusivity means considering the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities. Creating detailed representations of different learner groups, known as learning personas, helps tailor educational content. Group activities, such as brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and feedback circles, are effective methods for gathering insights about learner needs. 

To effectively identify learners' needs, educators should have access to and utilize specific Competency Profiles and Professional Standards relevant to their field of instruction. We focused on the competency-based approach that combines skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed to perform tasks effectively, focusing on outcomes, personalization, continuous improvement, real-world relevance, and clear competency definitions. The T-shaped competency framework combines deep expertise in one area with broad knowledge across multiple areas. 

Finally, we described the role of various accreditation bodies to ensure standardization, quality, and ethical practices in data science and AI. We provided 'The AdvanceHE Professional Standards Framework' as a case study, to outline professional values, core knowledge, and areas of activity essential for educators in higher education in the UK.
