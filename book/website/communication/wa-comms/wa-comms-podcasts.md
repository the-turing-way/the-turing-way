## What are podcasts

A podcast is an audio programme that you can subscribe to and listen to on an app. They are like blogs as they focus on a particular topic. A podcast can be a solo effort but would work better as collaborative work. The length of podcasts varies from short 1 minute snippets to much longer in-depth pieces lasting hours. They also vary in frequency from daily to monthly.
