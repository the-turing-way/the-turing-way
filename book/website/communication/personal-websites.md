## Motivation and Background

A personal website is an online space where researchers can share their work and additional interests with a broad audience.
It can serve as a platform to present research findings, projects, talks, publications, CV or resume, and other professional information.
But this space is not necessarily limited to academic content; it can also be a place to share personal interests, hobbies, and other activities.
As a result, this website can be customised to express the individual's unique identity and values.
This online presence can help researchers expand their visibility, engage with a wider audience, connect with potential collaborators, and even create new career opportunities.
