# Podcasts for Research Communication

A podcast is an audio programme that you can subscribe to and listen to on an app.
They are like blogs as they focus on a particular topic.
A podcast can be a solo effort but would work better as collaborative work.
The length of podcasts varies from short 1-minute snippets to much longer in-depth pieces lasting hours.
They also vary in frequency from daily to monthly.
