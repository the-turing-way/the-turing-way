# Communicating Effectively

We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, the general public, industry partners, data scientists from different teams {cite}`NationalAcademiesofSciences2016comms`.

## Science Writing versus Science Journalism

Effective communication to a wider audience requires changing your style to be less like a researcher and more like a journalist.
Researchers are trained to communicate with each other generally by first outlining the background of the problem, including references to previous work and the outstanding challenges, followed by a thorough description of the methodology before finally presenting results and discussing the implications of those results.
The approach starts with the very general, widest possible view of the particular field and gradually proceeds to the specifics of the individual study.
This is a general model and it is how most research is transmitted to other researchers, including oral presentations, journal articles, and visual illustrations such as posters or the sequence of figures in a paper.
Note that this [article on effective science writing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3009394/) tends to follow this structure.

Journalists take an approach that is completely inverted from this perspective.
Most news articles start with the detailed specifics about what happened and why it is important, and only after that initial information is conveyed, the more general background information begins to enter into the discussion.
This is exactly the reverse of a typical research paper, where these specifics come only at the end. In this journalist model, often referred to as the [Inverted Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)).
In this model, the audience gets the main point regardless of how far into the story they progress, and more peripheral details that might be important to the big picture but have little bearing on what actually happened are available but not the first thing that is encountered.

Communicating beyond a specific field or even beyond the wider community of researchers requires adapting your style to match that of a journalist rather than a researcher.
Rather than convincing your audience that you are researching a problem with a long history in the academic literature before talking about your specific study, you should instead focus exclusively on what single, main result of the study is and the impact it has on the individual.
In the following sections, specific questions are outlined that can help guide you towards thinking in this manner for various forms of communication, including oral, written, and visual.

## Oral Communication

The most common way of communicating your research results beyond your immediate field is oral. This can be done in environments as simple as a discussion with friends at the pub over meals or may involve more formal appearances in the media.
Specific avenues for oral communication are quite varied and include interviews, podcasts, public lectures, and just having casual conversations with people outside of your area of expertise.
It is best not to think about these like research talks, but instead to apply the above principles and treat them like conversations with different audiences with a specific message.
Unlike in technical presentations at conferences or seminars, where you are allotted enough time to follow the general to specific presentation methodology of a researcher, these oral discussions are usually very short (several minutes) and thus the journalist's method of leading with the main result tends to be more effective.

However, this change in tactics still requires prior thought as to how to best present your work. In particular, you need to think carefully about how to distil your main result into a single, clear, unambiguous message.
Additionally, you need to think about what the audience values and how your result impacts them as an individual in order to drive the message home regarding why they should care.
This is a skill that requires practise in order to develop, and it can be very helpful to think about and craft your message in advance and to practise explaining it to a friendly person that is outside of your area of expertise.

The following discussion is adapted from materials provided by [Compass Science Communication](https://www.compassscicomm.org/message-box-online).

**Define your audience:** Before thinking about your message content, you first need to define who your audience is and what they care about. The actual message will likely be different for different groups: you may have one message for the general public, one for government officials, and one for speaking with journalists.
You cannot expect that a single message will reach all people because each group have different values and things that matter to them.

**Describe your work using a short, single message:** Once your audience is identified, you need to craft your main message and cut out all of the side details that are not important to a broad audience.
For example, the author of a 2015 study about plastic waste in the ocean {cite}`Jambeck2015plasticwaste` speaking to a journalist might describe their main message as follows:

> We estimate that 8 million metric tonnes of plastic waste enters the ocean each year, or 13 kilograms for every metre of coastline in the world.

This message is short, succinct, and to the point, and emphasises the main result of the study. It does not go into detail about how the methodologies by which this number was estimated, or what other studies have been done previously.
Those pieces of information are not important for a journalist, who just would like a clear number that they can provide to illustrate the scale of the problem.

Once the main message is identified, then you can begin to fill in the other relevant details, keeping in mind what your audience is and what is important to them. Important questions to ask include:

**What is the problem?** What, broadly, is the question being addressed?

**So What?** How does this impact the person you are speaking to?

**Solutions?** How does the work address the concerns mentioned above?

**Benefits?** How does your solution help people? What are the short and long term implications?

Note that these questions will require you to fill in many background details, but by first specifying the main message, you can be judicious as to which details are necessary for someone to understand your results and how it can be connected to things that they care about.

Once you have thought through these details in advance, it is a good idea to practice describing your work to people within your target audience and elicit feedback as to how understandable your message was and to point out areas of confusion or places where technical jargon may have crept into the discussion.
By repeatedly speaking to target audience members, you can dramatically improve this skill and your ability to transmit your research results beyond your peers.

## Written Communication

Another common way to disseminate research results is in writing.
Avenues for written communication span social media, blog posts, press releases, and articles in the news media.
However, in many cases, a journalist or institutional communications officer may be writing the actual document based on an oral discussion or comments provided in writing.
Many of the same principles described above apply to written communication: you need to think like a journalist and write following an 'inverted pyramid' structure, which differs from the standard flow of standard technical writing.

Many of the same questions you should ask yourself to distil your message described in the oral communication section apply equally well to writing.
An important first step is to identify your audience and what matters to them, and then craft your message to align with their stake in the problem. Then, defining the core message and the relevant auxiliary details will help you determine how to best present your findings.

However, in some cases writing allows for more details to be transmitted than in short oral presentations -- for instance, press releases often have space for more details than a short oral interview, and so you will need to think about whether or not specific details are relevant given the amount of space involved.
Therefore, you may need to revisit the questions above multiple times to ensure that the correct level of detail is given for a particular audience and the length of the document.

As with oral communication, feedback and revision based on presenting to a member of the target audience are essential.
Good writers go through multiple drafts and make extensive edits, and specific comments from the type of person that you are attempting to reach can go a long way to ensuring that the right level of detail is provided and the motivating factors align with the interests and values of the audience.

## Visual Communication

Visual communication provides a way to include actual data into your message.
This can be done in a variety of media, ranging from simple graphics designed to illustrate a point to complex web-apps to explore and visualise data.
Researchers often produce graphics that are good at illustrating a technical point but may not fully emphasize the main message. The goal of adapting graphics for communicating research to a wider audience is to remove any information that is not necessary to tell the main story.
If you are trying to communicate your ideas to a journalist, it can be very helpful to have this in mind when crafting any graphics that you share with them, which is likely to help get your ideas across and tell a coherent and accurate story (example {cite}`Elliott2019viz`).
Other avenues for visual communication include posters, slides, and multimedia such as videos and cartoons can be useful ways to add additional visual dimensions to how you communicate results.

News articles that cover research results often derive visuals from the research article itself.
In this case, many news outlets have illustrators in the house who create these visuals based on the originals in the paper.
However, significant editing usually takes place before placing a graphic in a news article such that the original is modified in many ways.
For some excellent examples of this, a [talk by a NY Times science illustrator](http://style.org/ku/) provides some insight into the variety of ways that different graphics have been adapted for use by the newspaper.
Note however that the talk makes it crystal clear that one needs to define the audience prior to making any illustrations, and that his audience is NY Times readers.

As with the discussion above, once the audience has been defined and the message that the illustration needs to convey has been set, the illustrator went through multiple iterations and solicited immediate feedback from editors and other non-specialists to hone the clarity of the presentation.
Note that this is similar to the process of refining the oral or editing the written message as detailed above.
In many cases, researchers often make a quick and dirty figure using the standard settings on a graphics package and do not go through extensive revisions to ensure that the figure is clear, not misleading, and contains no extraneous information that would detract from the main message.

There is a range of ways to illustrate information visually.
One idea of how to arrange this is from Scientific American Art Director Jen Christensen {cite}`Christiansen2021viz`.

As Christensen shows, at one end of the spectrum you have illustrations that are figurative and just meant to provide a picture of the content under question.
As you move towards the abstract, you begin to get illustrations that are warped in ways to illustrate some principle to improve the understanding of the audience but remain illustrations to varying degrees.
Finally, at the right you reach the full level of abstraction where you find quantitative data shown on a graph, removing any trace of the actual appearance of the object.
In many cases, technical research (and certainly data science) will fall entirely on the abstract side of things, while a presentation to a different audience may require some movement towards the figurative end of the spectrum to give a concrete understanding of what is being studied.
