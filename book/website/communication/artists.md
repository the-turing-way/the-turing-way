# Collaborating with artists

(cm-artists-why)=
## Why collaborate with artists?
People receive messages through five senses: touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. 
Just as people are different, so the ways they understand messages differ. 
Artists use a variety of different communication media to creatively communicate messages to different groups through different senses. 
Some use paintings, photographs, or graphics. 
Others focus on music, sounds, theatre and performance in general.
The list is endless. 
Sometimes, art becomes a powerful way to communicate messages to people in a way that people can relate to.
Art is also often more accessible not only in the language that it uses, but in the abscence of a paywall to access art.

### Challenges
Cooperation with artists might be a challenging process because of the different way many scientists and artists see the world. 
This is also the reason the results can be powerful and reach a wider audience. 
"Scientists work within very tight constraints: experiments must probe the nature of the world and must be reproducible; hypotheses must account for observations in a logical way; and most importantly, scientists must then devise new ways to test and possibly destroy these hypotheses with further experimentation."
Fine artists have far fewer constraints. 
As they create work that speaks to their audiences, they are limited only by imagination and the technicalities and seductions of their chosen media. 
Consequently, fine artists need to create entire worlds from scratch." [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-021-00587-5]
The most common challenges in such cooperation include:
**Planning:** Whether you involve artists in your research process or at the end to communicate results, it is always better to start discussions early to be able to arrive at an outcome within the timeframe that fits both yours and artists' planning, and be flexible should things not go the way you plan. 
They most often do not.
**Abandon expectations:** Managing expectations is key when working with artists. Because scientists and artists speak different languages, it often translates into a difference in expectations. The best way for both to cooperate in a pleasant way is to abandon all expectations and allow the co-creation process to do its job.
