# Managing Multiple X Accounts

Managing multiple accounts on X (formerly Twitter) can be challenging and you might be following a certain social media policy or approach that is different from how you would tweet from your personal account.

Many projects and organisations have their own X account that is used for advertising their research outputs and events.

## Managing an Organisational X Account

**1. Be sure that you are clear about what the purpose of the account is and the type of tweets that the organisation wants.**

* Is it going to be a professional tone or more relaxed and fun.
* Are there certain restrictions about what content you can tweet about such as not sharing data or results?

**2. Use scheduling to time your tweets**

* This can be done through the X web browser or by using an X app such as X Pro (formerly Tweetdeck).
* X Pro is the only app owned by X.
It was previously free to use but now requires a paid X Premium subscription.
But there are [other apps for all different platforms](https://www.reviewgeek.com/52119/the-best-twitter-apps-for-every-platform/), although you often have to pay for their services too.
* There are other apps, such as [Buffer](https://buffer.com/), that you can use to control multiple social media channels.
* Scheduling tweets is particularly helpful if you are running an event as you can schedule tweets well in advance to give important information.

**3. Preventing miss tweeting**

* When you are responsible for multiple tweeter accounts, there is the possibility of miss tweeting.
This is when you tweet out, for example, a personal tweet using an organisational account.
* X Pro has a feature that allows you to add a confirmation step to perform an extra check before tweeting.
This helps to prevent this issue.

**4. Enabling multiple users of the same account**

* Also on X Pro, you can [set up an account as a team to allow multiple users to have different access](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/postdeck-teams).
* There will be one person that is the admin for the account and then the other users are contributors.
* As a contributor you can post Tweets, Direct Message, like, and Retweet for the team account.
You cannot change the password or manage account settings.
