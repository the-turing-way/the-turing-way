# Managing Multiple Twitter Accounts

Managing multiple accounts on Twitter can be challenging and you might be following a certain social media policy or approach that is different from how you would tweet from your personal account.

Many projects and organisations have their own Twitter account that is used for advertising their research outputs and events.

## Managing an Organisational Twitter Account

**1. Be sure that you are clear about what the purpose of the account is and the type of tweets that the organisation wants.**

* Is it going to be a professional tone or more relaxed and fun.
* Are there certain restrictions about what content you can tweet about such as not sharing data or results?

**2. Use scheduling to time your tweets**

* This can be done through the Twitter web browser or by using a Twitter app such as Tweetdeck.
* Tweetdeck is the only app owned by Twitter and it is free to use.
But there are [other apps for all different platforms](https://www.reviewgeek.com/52119/the-best-twitter-apps-for-every-platform/), although you often have to pay for their services.
* There are other apps, such as [Buffer](https://buffer.com/), that you can use to control multiple social media channels.
* Scheduling tweets is particularly helpful if you are running an event as you can schedule tweets well in advance to give important information.

**3. Preventing miss tweeting**

* When you are responsible for multiple tweeter accounts, there is the possibility of miss tweeting.
This is when you tweet out, for example, a personal tweet using an organisational account.
* Tweetdeck has a feature that allows you to add a confirmation step to perform an extra check before tweeting.
This helps to prevent this issue.

**4. Enabling multiple users of the same account**

* Also on Tweetdeck, you can [set up an account as a team to allow multiple users to have different access](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tweetdeck-teams).
* There will be one person that is the admin for the account and then the other users are contributors.
* As a contributor you can post Tweets, Direct Message, like, and Retweet for the team account.
You cannot change the password or manage account settings.
