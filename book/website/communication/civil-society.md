# Collaborating with Civil Society

## Involve civil society to reach the right audience in the right way

### What is civil society

Civil society is any community united around an issue, common interests and/or a joint activity. 
Civil society can be a formal organization or an unofficial community. 

### Why involve civil society

Collaboting with civil society can add a lot of value to your research, particularly when your research has a specific target audience outside of academia. 
For example, you might be researching something that is relevant for persons with disabilities, or a specific neighbourhood within a city. 
Not only can your research benefit from reaching out to the people who belong to these communities, but these same people might benefit immensely from your research results. 
However, reaching out to individuals within these communities might be difficult if not impossible. 
Civil society (organisations) can be of great help in reaching out to these communities. 
They usually: 
- have access to the right audience,
- use channels of communication that are inclusive and targeted to a specific audience (associations of persons with speficic disabilities or neighbourhood chat in case of examples above),
- and use language that is inclusive and effective for this specific target audience.

If your research is intended to have an impact on the communities the civil society represents, such communities have an extra benefit of helping you spread the word and often have the capacity to support your activities. 

### How to involve civil society

In order to involve civil society, you need to think about about the target audience first. 
Once you have identified the audience, you can search on the internet to find out which organisations or communities would be relevant to contact. 
If your audience has a specific geographic distribution, you could also try contacting local government office to find connections. 
Reach out to these communities in whichever their preferred communication channel is. 
Not every community has a website where such information might be available, so it is important that you find the right contact to connect you further. 
Strategies for this could range from the contacts at the municipality to going door to door, or contacting a hospital, retirement home, social workers and others. 
Such efforts might be time-consuming, but usually pay off well in the end when you realise how much impact your research brings to not just society as a whole, but specific people whose everyday lives are changed for the better.
