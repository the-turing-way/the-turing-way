# Considerations for in-person and virtual onboarding

The previous section covered key processes to consider when onboarding an individual to any project. 

Joining a new group virtually is a very different experience from joining in person. Here we cover some of the ways in which the onboarding needs may differ between the two scenarios.

## Introducing the Team

It can be intimidating to be the first to speak as a new member - consider asking your team to introduce themselves first in meetings. Initial introductions could be part of the role of a buddy (see below).

Names and roles are also easy to forget, particularly if we aren't seeing people in the office every day.
It can be helpful to store this information somewhere, for example, by sending around an introductory or onboarding email.
Also consider organising online social events, such as coffee chats or team activity like a video game or escape room, to help new members integrate into the group.

For virtual onboarding it may be overwhelming to meet everybody at once in a big video call (compare this to in-person, where you might be introduced to people individually). Consider ways in which to make this less intimidating, for example meeting a subset of the team beforehand.

An onboarding event sharing important information like contact details, organigram, shared calendar, resources available to everyone, organisation policy and social norms can be extremely useful.

## Support

A difficult part of virtual onboarding is that it is hard to know if someone is struggling or isolated. 

You can provide one-on-one support, such as a buddy for informal peer support, or a mentor for more formal support. You may provide more than one buddy to take the pressure off individual relationships and also so that a remote-starter immediately meets another person.

This helps the new joiner understand group norms, and allows them to ask any sensitive questions they wouldn't like to raise in a group discussion.

You should consider that the buddy or mentor should remain for a longer period than would be needed with in person onboarding. 

To help keep an informal relationship you may want to ensure that the buddy is not the line manager or collaborating with the new-starter on their first piece of work.

Co-working with a buddy or several team members is another informal way to build relationships with new team members and is an informal environment to address any questions that may have arisen in the first few days or weeks of employment.

## Equipment

Equipment provision and internet access are key requirements for working on a project. For virtual onboarding helping provision a suitable home working environment may be a more important consideration than in person. 

## Working hours

Collaborating virtually often has less working scheduling constraints than in-person collaboration, and also different projects lend themselves to different levels of flexibility. These norms should be communicated in the onboarding material.


## Accessibility

Access needs differ across virtual and in-person settings. For in-person there are the practical needs of information around transport links and access to buildings. For virtual collaboration the access needs will focus more around communication needs, such as access to zoom callsw.

## Socialisation norms

There may be different social norms for virtual work compared to in-person work. It is helpful to make these norms clear to help an onboarder integrate. For example, when do people take coffee breaks, where do people sit at lunchtime? Does how the group communicate differ between virtual (for example slack) and in-person settings (for example noticeboards)? Are there any dress code considerations for in-person work?
