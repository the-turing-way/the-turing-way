# Important Aspects of Onboarding

Onboarding processes and structures will vary depending on the needs of the project, the types of people who participate, and the frequency that new contributors join. 

A good onboarding process achieves the following: 
1. Helps team members feel a supported part of the team and start building connections within the team and wider community
2. Empowers the team member to get up to speed and start contributing faster 
3. Ensures that team members have access to the resources and information they need
4. Clearly communicates policies and ways to working early on to establish the team or community norms and best practices, helping to avoid misunderstandings, and maintaining a positive culture 
5. All the above points supports sustainable engagement with a project, helping people become regular contributors
