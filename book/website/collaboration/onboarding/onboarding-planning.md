# Planning and Processes

When thinking about designing onboarding, there are several areas to consider. 

It may be useful to lay these areas out explicitly in an onboarding document, manual or folder of resources.

This creates a set of shared expectations and acts as a reference for new members to find information about resources or who to ask for help.

We briefly describe areas to consider below.


## Suggested Considerations

### Group Culture

Every group or workplace has a different culture, and expectations aren't always clear when a new member joins.
You can help them settle in by making the culture clear in written form.

Making group culture explicit can be especially important for people who experience discrimination - do they know that they can approach you and be listened to if they experience harassment or discrimination?

Group culture sections can include:
* What is expected as part of the team - turnaround times for feedback, support, and communication.
* Expectations for working hours and flexible working policies.
* Equality, inclusion, and diversity statement.
* Open science and how you expect the group to practice this.
* Team code of conduct.
* A list of meetings/projects to shadow so that new members can get a feel for how team members interact.

### Key Contacts

It can be hard to ask for help, particularly when working remotely - you can't just lean over to the person at the next desk and ask! 

Key contacts could include:
* Group technicians/managers.
* Key collaborators, and information on what areas of the project they are involved in.
* IT - include detail - is there a form, or a specific person to email?

### Communication Channels

- Preferred method of communications, _for example email, video call, slack message_
- Ensure any communication preferences are ..communicated.. from the beginning.

It should be a priority that the new team member is sent all relevant information to join these communications channels, and someone should check that they have been able to set them up.
Offer help with this process, and also training on any communications channel that the new team member has not used before so that they can communicate with the other team members quickly after joining.

### Accessing Shared Documents

- What method of sharing is preferred? _for example google docs, RMarkdown, shared documents over email, GitHub, OneDrive_
- Ensure invitations are set up for calendar meetings and access is in place.
- Where are useful project materials held? Such as:
    - Materials that clearly spell out the aims of the project
    - Reference materials such as group policies.

### Expectations in Meetings

- Individuals may not have adequate access to equipment or the internet.
Discussions about whether any support is required for home setup (for example webcams, microphone, laptop) can allow for any needs to be addressed.
- Meeting etiquette - learning expectations for different meetings can be overwhelming for a new starter.
Clearly outlining expected attendance and contributions can help overcome this, _for example, are attendees required to read the papers prior to journal club? Are attendees asked to present their work regularly? Are you expecting their video to be on?_
- Meeting times - consider the circumstances of your group when organising regular meetings - does everyone have the same opportunity to attend? _for example some groups try to arrange Athena SWAN meeting times, whereby meetings occur between 10-3, meaning that those with children are more able to attend_.

### Training

On tools and systems used by the group - for example GitHub and communication channels such as Slack.

* Use [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), or a similar open repository, to host training materials for easier sharing.
* Use a YouTube channel to store induction & training material for people to watch in their own time.
* Consider running training and induction sessions frequently as new people join.
* Consider a Slack channel for new joiners - for questions and discussion.
* Consider providing Office Hours to support new joiners using new tools - for example, GitHub.
* Try to make your training sessions as interactive as possible with exercises and discussions.
* Get feedback on your training and use this to adjust and improve your resources.

### Resources

* Link to the group website.
* Link to group social media accounts - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
* Links to other resources - institution wellbeing services.
* Links to group policies.

### Glossary

Are there any weird acronyms in your field/group?
Consider sharing them with new members - then they'll know exactly what obscure software you're referring to!

### Pathways to contribution

It may also be useful to connect onboarding process content to {ref}`Personas and Pathways to contribution<pd-persona>` for a project if these have been mapped, to help with introducing the different ways people might contribute. 

Onboarding doesn’t have to provide an exhaustive list of every single way to participate, but it should give people the knowledge and tools they need to find out more about the areas that interest them. 


## Planning Considerations

At the end of onboarding, new team members should have a strong idea of: 
* How the team interacts and its working patterns (such as meetings, communication channels, file storage, review processes) 
* Where to find policies, procedures, codes of conduct, and other information about the project 
* Which tools are used by the project and how to find out more about how to use them 
* How and where to ask questions 
* Opportunities to get involved more deeply in the project or community 

You should plan out your onboarding process to take each of these things into account. 

Additionally, an onboarding process also needs to instil confidence and not overwhelm the new team member. 
To help with this, one could:

- Space out communication, with the onboarding process potentially starting a some time before the new member joining the team.
- Give some indication of the relative importance of each topic so that the team member does not feel that they need to learn everything at once. 
- Consider a dedicate period (for example a week) where there is no obligation to carry out any formal work.


It’s also useful to make the onboarding process transparent, such as storing materials in a dedicated folder in the project repository, so that it’s easier to scale, have someone else lead the onboarding, or to identify missing sections through feedback from the community.


Onboarding in-person or virtually can raise different challenges and things to consider.  
The next section touches on the key differences.
