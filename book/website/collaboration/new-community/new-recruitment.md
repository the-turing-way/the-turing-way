# Inclusive recruitment strategies to attract diverse job applicants

## Mission statement

This chapter focuses on recruitment, providing practical strategies, resources and processes to reach a diverse pool of job applicants.
It does not cover processes after the closing of the job advert such as sifting, shortlisting or interviewing.
The intended audience is hiring managers and/or team members involved in the recruitment process, and not Human Resources (HR) specialists or dedicated recruiters. 
These recommendations are intended to be used alongside existing recruitment processes or guidelines within your respective organisation.

While our examples will often draw from data science scenarios, the principles and strategies discussed are applicable across various tech roles and sectors.

This document contains a suggested set of actions and timeframes, which may vary across organisations, as hiring processes are different.

Whilst this document focuses on suggestions to attract diverse candidates, you must be aware that there will be different legal obligations around hiring based on certain characteristics depending on the country you’re hiring in. 
For example, the UK has the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights) in place that legally protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. 

There are nine protected characteristics which are legally protected under the Equality Act 2010. 

These are (in no particular order): 
* age 
* gender reassignment
* being married or in a civil partnership
* [being pregnant](https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights) or on maternity leave
* [disability](https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010)
* race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin
* religion or belief
* sex
* sexual orientation

In some circumstances, you can use protected characteristics to help a disadvantaged or an underrepresented group during the recruitment process, for example by making reasonable adjustments for disability. 
This can help your organisation to be more diverse and representative. 
However, it is important to know what is possible and what could be against the law. 
Your action must not cause 'detriment' to another protected group (where someone is treated worse or discriminated against relative to someone else).

Although you may want to make an impact to progress your team/organisation’s diversity, for example by  bringing more underrepresented groups from a STEM background into the organisation, it does not mean you can discount other candidates that meet the essential criteria, simply based on characteristics such as gender and/or age. 
This would be classed as unlawful discrimination. 

Positive action can be used to encourage underrepresented groups to apply for roles at your organisation, however, there are limits to this and it’s recommended that you consult with your HR team before creating any initiatives. 
The UK Government has [guidance on their website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-action-in-the-workplace-guidance-for-employers/positive-action-in-the-workplace) on the differences between positive discrimination and positive action.


## Why aim for a diverse pool of job applicants?

Building a diverse applicant pool and team isn't just the right thing to do morally and ethically; it's a strategic advantage that can drive business success and ensure work is carried out at the highest standards (see [Cheng and Zhange (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3134) for a review).

Outlined below are business case arguments for incorporating practical strategies to attract diverse applicants into recruitment practices:  




1. **Enhanced innovation and problem-solving** 
Diverse teams bring together varied perspectives, experiences, and approaches, creating a possibility for more creative solutions and innovative ideas. 

2. **Improved decision-making** 
A diverse workforce helps mitigate unconscious bias, such as groupthink, resulting in more balanced and well-rounded decisions.
For instance, a diverse data science team is more likely to recognise and address potential biases in datasets or machine learning models. 

5. **Broader talent pool** 
By taking concrete steps to cast a wider net, you increase your chances of finding exceptional talent that might otherwise be overlooked - particularly in competitive professions in which demand often outpaces supply. 

6. **Enhanced company reputation** 
Organisations known for their commitment to diversity often attract top talent across all demographics. 

7. **Compliance and social responsibility** 
While not the primary driver, having a diverse workforce demonstrates corporate social responsibility, which is increasingly important to stakeholders.

It’s important to recognise that attracting a diverse candidate pool is just the first step. 
Ensuring that your entire recruitment process, from application to onboarding, is designed to support and encourage diversity is something that falls outside the scope of this chapter but is crucial for success. 
While casting a wide net is important, it's equally crucial to ensure your message resonates with diverse candidates and that your application process is accessible and inclusive.




## Advertising/dissemination

Dissemination and getting your job under the eyes of as wide an audience as possible will be the key to attracting a diverse candidate pool. 
This can be done both internally and externally, in addition to processes the recruitment team at your organisation may already have in place. 
Key to this is targeted outreach to encourage under-represented groups to apply.


### Leveraging internal expertise and networks

Work with your Recruitment Team to facilitate connection to internal networks or interest groups across your organisation. 
For instance, involving the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) team and/or a staff networks relevant to disability, gender, LGBTQ+, race. 
Doing this early in the recruitment process demonstrates a genuine commitment to diversity and integration into the recruitment strategy from the start rather than being an afterthought. 
These internal experts will have valuable insights for identifying diverse talent pools, networks and job boards. They can help you provide targeted outreach to under-represented groups, give guidance on cultural competence and help you tailor your approach to attract a wider range of candidates.


### Social media and outreach 

Depending on your organisation’s social media policy, how you share the role online in your personal networks and brand accounts can also influence its reach. 
Sharing job postings in targeted LinkedIn groups (for example Diversity in Tech), and using targeted hashtags (for example #DiversityInTech, #WomenInAI) can give your advert a wider spread, reaching  candidates who may not otherwise encounter it.


### Targeting external networks and organisations 

Targeting external organisations and networks with a focus on underrepresented groups will broaden your reach. 
We have included some suggestions around this in the Resources section.


## Checklist for recruitment 

The checklist and timeline below outline a range of activities which can be undertaken to increase the diversity of your applicant pool. 
This list is not exhaustive so you will need to consult your organisation’s recruitment policies and recommendations. 
Having a specific timeline outlined and communicated from the start of the recruitment process is important not only for hiring teams but also for applicants. 


### Before advertising 



- [ ] Ensure effective communication  between hiring manager and recruitment team - know what your recruitment team is already doing (for example  where roles will be advertised) to avoid working in silos
- [ ] Writing the job description (JD)
    * Detail what the person will be doing
         * Recommend 10-12 bullet points
         * Focus on the tasks to be completed rather than _how_ the task is completed
    * Write in plain English, removing any jargon and abbreviations
    * Consider unconscious bias against all characteristics - often unconscious bias moves beyond the nine protected characteristics and into dimensions such as education level, socioeconomic status, geography, and hobbies.
        * Avoid superlatives
        * Check for accessibility of advert using a screen reader
        * Keep mandatory skills to a minimum and thoroughly consider whether all criteria are essential
        * Avoid asking for mandatory travel, weekend work and overtime, if possible
    * Remove all biased language in the job advert
        * Consider using a gender decoder to identify words/phrases that may imply a specific gender and re-phrase if needed
    * Provide clear guidelines & deadlines plus instructions & contacts for people requiring reasonable adjustments 
        * Provide transparency over interview structure and application assessment criteria where possible 
    * Include relevant policies clearly in the job advert 
    * Be transparent about the compensation package
        * Provide a starting salary or salary range 
        * Include any statutory or enhanced benefits your organisation may offer such as paternity, maternity and parental leave and/or benefits such as time off for dependents, and annual leave entitlement. 
    * Directly reference your organisational EDI commitment
        * Include your organisational Diversity Statement where available.
        * Include your organisational Values (if applicable).
        * Include you team's personal commitment to Equity, Diversity and Inclusive (if applicable). 
- [ ] Post job advert 
    * Consider the best places to advertise to reach a diverse pool of candidates
        * See “ Resources” section for suggestions of advertising venues
        * If certain demographics are often missing from your pool, utilise spaces that target those groups
        * Consider reviewing the diversity of the pool attained from previous, similar advertising and seek specific advertising to reach other groups that were underrepresented 
    * Use a gender decoder to review the advert after you have created it
    * Consider digital accessibility on social media and in job adverts
      Not all advertising venues are digitally accessible (See "Resources" for more reading)
    * Leverage your networks, as well as those of others in the organisation, to share the opportunity advertised for example, Slack, LinkedIn, word of mouth at conferences 
        * When utilising your networks, consider if there are any groups potentially missing. Consider using alternative spaces (examples listed in Resources section) to reach groups that aren’t in your network.
      *If including images in the job advert or description, ensure alternative text is included (See "Resources" for more reading)
         *Any links to other websites or pages should be linked in the text and not in images
- [ ] Set a suitable closing deadline
    * Ensure a closing date is included on the advert
        * Advertise roles minimally for 2-4 weeks where possible
    * Where possible, stick to the advertised close date. Avoid stating that the role will be closed early if a suitable candidate is identified.  
    * Consider the day of the week and time of closing your advert. For example, a closing date set on a weekend may be valuable for people who have limited free time.
    * Be explicit on the time zone which will be used to close the application period 



### Before job advert closes



- [ ] Book time(s) for interview panel *[Contributing to this action may be out of scope for hiring managers depending on organisational processes]*
    * Consider flexibility and other requirements for applicants AND members of the interview panel.
  For example, ensuring that panel members have sufficient  breaks and that flexibility in scheduling can be offered to applicants - planning should be undertaken in partnership with your HR team.  
    * Ensure there is a diverse interview panel for every interview - consider gender, race, diversity of thought, interest/impacted group perspective. 
    * Consider having the option of both in-person or remote interviews for candidates to select from
        - [ ] Consider providing reimbursement for expenses incurred for candidates attending in-person interviews 
- [ ] Decide on assessments and criteria
    * Be clear on what criteria is being used for shortlisting
    * Ensure assessment criteria focus on the person specification within the job description. This should help mitigate bias during hiring decisions later on.


### At the deadline 



- [ ] Close job advert 
    * Be transparent with the status of the application and timelines
    * Ensure reasonable timeframes are kept when making decisions 
    * Either at this stage, or at the end of the process, review anonymised demographic data of candidates to see if your advertising avenues were ‘effective’, how ever this may be determined by your organisation
