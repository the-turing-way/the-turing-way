# Roadmapping

If you plan a large piece of work, it will be good to produce an outline of the work you need to do and share it with potential contributors.
Your roadmap should cover your goal and vision and include a timeline for tasks that need to be completed, thus helping new contributors to your project to get an understanding of what is currently happening on the project and what's coming next.
A roadmap is also a great tool to highlight dependencies among tasks, helping you to schedule work on them efficiently.

Milestones can be really helpful to reach your main goal.
They can be organised around your project goals, dates, events, or timeframes.
If you work on GitHub, you can use [GitHub's Project board](https://help.github.com/en/articles/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-project-boards) to manage tasks and issues.



>***Case Study: AutSPACES***

In order to create a roadmap, it is important to map out the key milestones, tasks needed to accomplish the milestones and the issues in the your repository that relate to these. 

Github is a great resource to collect all this information in a collaborative and open way. 

To successfully communicate where we are and what needs to be done, the AutSPACEs project has created a highly detailed Roadmap.

**How did we get started?**

To kickstart the creation of a Roadmap we used the issues function in GitHub to begin the journey of creating a Roadmap. Here, we have raised an issue in our GitHub repository where we invite contributors to comment any porposed milestones and surrounding tasks that should be included in the roadmap. 

The Community Manager will collate all the information to produce a Roadmap that will be proficient for the community. 

**What does our Roadmap include?**

The road map will include high level milestones which are made up of a list of issues of which each contains a checklist with granular tasks. This will inform any contributor where they can start participating within the project. 

Milestones, in this project, are seen more as an overaching theme rather than a tick list. The idea behind this is that we don't want to tick off a milstone as we believe work in continous, open and subject to review and iteration in all aspects. 

Key timelines and dependencies will be highlighted as this will allow for all contributors to know how each task fits in to the wider project. There will be a prioritisation of tasks that correlate with the strategic direction of the project; what is needed to be done at this point in time. 

**Where will we put our Roadmap?**

The AutSPACEs project is a Citizen Science and Participatory Research project. This means that many of our contributors do not have the technical expertise to use GitHub. Therefore, we need to ensure that our roadmap is accessible for all and thus not only accessed via GitHub. Therefore, our roadmap will be hosted:
- On our website
- In Microsoft Excel
- Github Markdown

However, we will adress this technical barrier as our roadmap will include link to issues in the repositoty. To overcome this, we have planned to teach basic skills in GitHub, such as creating an account and accessing our issues list.

**How we will keep it updated?**

One of the main issues with Roadmaps and similarly project plans, is the risk of them becoming out of date. This puts a strain on the project and it's community as it can cause confusion on where the project is and where it needs to go. 

The AutSPACEs project conducts fortnightly progress updates that focus on updates from Community, Software Development and Research as well as specifically what tasks have been completed that fornight and which need to be completed in the next. 

These updates will drive and feed into the updating of the roadmap. This will allow us to ensure that our roadmap an taks priorites are always up to date.
