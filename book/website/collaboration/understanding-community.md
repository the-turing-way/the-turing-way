## Motivation and Background

Why is it important to periodically check-in with your community, both formally and informally? 
All communities change over time.

People join, become more involved, or leave a project. The goals of the community might change, the project becomes more popular or complex, or the funding situation changes. 
The community might need to report externally on certain measures, or demonstrate that a particular grant achieved its aims. 
In order to make decisions which align with the strategic goals, values, and mission of the project, leaders also need to be able to understand where their community currently is, in relation to where it wants or needs to be. 

These are just some of the reasons why you might use a selection of the methods discussed in this chapter to evaluate your community, with the intention of better understanding it.
