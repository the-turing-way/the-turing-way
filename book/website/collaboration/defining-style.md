# Defining Your Project's Collaboration Style

Before you start a new collaboration we encourage you to develop your answers to the following questions of "how", "who", "why", "where" and "when"?

This chapter will guide you through the following considerations:

* **How**: Is this project developed following open source or [inner source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) practices?
* **Who**: Who are your community or team? Are you open to new members joining or would you prefer to work with a predefined group?
* **Why**: What is the purpose of this specific task? Why are these people coming together to collaborate as part of the broader project plan?
* **When**: Is the specific interaction you're thinking of best supported by synchronous or asynchronous collaboration?
* **Where**: Are your team connecting remotely, in person, or a hybrid combination of both options?
