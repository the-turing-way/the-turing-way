# Project Maintenance

An open source project allows many people to make contributions in the form of [issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
Community members can also perform [reviews](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) and provide feedback [comments](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) on the ideas and changes which they or others have suggested.
These ideas and discussions lead to a better quality of resources that are developed collaboratively and bring new perspectives regarding a particular feature.
Such a review process is a common practice in small tech companies or start-ups where different teams work together to develop high-quality production level code or resources.
The major role of a maintainer is to provide support with keeping the existing code updated by keeping track of new contributions.
Whenever a new feature is added or a new idea is proposed in a project, the corresponding changes must be made in relevant resources in the project and the documentation.
It requires [opening](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue),[deleting](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/deleting-an-issue) and [linking](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) important issues, [reviewing](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request), [labelling](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/labeling-issues-and-pull-requests), [changing the stages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request), [merging](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request) and [closing](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/closing-a-pull-request) important pull requests.
A common understanding of version control systems, [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and open source [workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) helps to a great extent in carrying out all these tasks.
