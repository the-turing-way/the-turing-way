# Guidelines for Hybrid Collaboration

## Chairing Hybrid Events
- Facilitator should take care of either both in person and online, or have a seperate online facilitator to make sure that the online audience is not lost.
- For all sessions, chairs should receive instructions on how to include both types of participants.
- See [An honest* guide to facilitating hybrid events](https://www.sessionlab.com/blog/hybrid-events-guide) for more information.

## Organising Hybrid Conferences

### Scheduling

- You're organising two events: in person and online. 
    - If you're separating in person and online (a couple of days in person and a couple of days online), it is easier to handle.
    - If taking place simultanously it takes different planning and it is more challenging as you will be running two events at the same time. 

- Online participants might have to join at times that are not core working hours for them. Keep this in mind especially for interactive parts.
- If some aspects of the agenda only apply to one participant group, be clear about this. For example, do not schedule a networking session that turns out to just be the in person coffee break without being clear how you expect online participants to network. 

### Location

- should reserve rooms for break out interaction with online participants.
- In person it takes time to move to breakout rooms/other rooms, online this is done much quicker.
- Make sure technical set up is in order: online audience should be able to hear the speaker and questions asked and be able to see the slides. 
    - Check microphones/video/slide sharing before.
    - Make sure everyone in the room uses microphones when speaking.
    - Ensure speakers introduce themselves as otherwise, it can be difficult for remote participants to identify who is talking.
- Select a space that has all the facilities (internet, proper seating/desk). How to ensure that online individuals have the space so that they can fully participate (space/focus/food/internet connection).
    - Check if there are free localities available in the areas of online participants (university, libraries).
    - Caring/child support may be needed for people with care taking responsibilities. (applies to both online and in person participants).
    - If you're at your own university/working place, you may be distracted by your colleagues that do not realise that you're in an event: consider reserving a space in a different part of the building. 
    
- How can you ensure that online participants are able to block off their calendar to have the proper space to attend the event.

## Organising Hybrid Meetings

- Plan earlier so that people can block their calendars
- Plan on movement (time & space)

## How to manage Hybrid teams

## # Tools for Hybrid Collaboration

- Proper microphone system for all the in-person groups
- Proper documentation for both in-person and remote groups. Documentation: a shared note taking document or more of a facilitation guide to ensure both groups are included?
