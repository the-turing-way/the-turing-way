# Guidelines for Hybrid Collaboration

## Chairing Hybrid Events
- The Facilitator should take care of either both in-person and online, or there could be a seperate online facilitator to make sure that the online audience is not lost.
- For all sessions, chairs should receive instructions on how to include both types of participants.
- See [An honest* guide to facilitating hybrid events](https://www.sessionlab.com/blog/hybrid-events-guide) for more information.

## Organising Hybrid Conferences

### Scheduling

- Organising a hybrid event is like organising two events: in-person and online. 
    - If you're separating in-person and online (a couple of days in-person and a couple of days online), it might be easier to handle.
    - If both modes take place simultanously it takes different planning and it is more challenging as you will be running two events at the same time. 

- Online participants might have to join at times that are not core working hours for them. Keep this in mind especially for interactive parts.
- If some aspects of the agenda only apply to one participant group, be clear about this. For example, do not schedule a networking session that turns out to just be the in person coffee break without being clear how you expect online participants to network. 

### Location

- Reserve rooms for break out interaction with online participants.
- For in-person people it might take some time to physically move to other rooms, whereas for people online this it might be faster to move to a different breakout room. Please consider such time requirements when switching rooms either physically or virtually. 
- Make sure technical set up is in order: online audience should be able to hear the speaker and questions asked and be able to see the slides. 
    - Check microphones, video and/or slide sharing before.
    - Make sure everyone in the room uses microphones when speaking.
    - Ensure speakers introduce themselves as otherwise, it can be difficult for remote participants to identify who is talking.
    - A online facilitator can message on the online platform, each time a new person starts speaking ("Person-A" is speaking now).
- Select a space that has all the facilities (internet, proper seating/desk). 
- Ensure that online individuals have the time space so that they can fully participate (space for focus time, food breaks).
    - Check if there are free localities available in the areas of online participants (university, libraries) which might also provide good internet connection.
    - Caring/child support may be needed for people with care taking responsibilities (applies to both online and in person participants).
    - If someone is at their own university/working place, they may be distracted by their colleagues who do not realise that someone is in an event. In such a case, consider reserving a quite space in your university/work place. 

## Organising Hybrid Meetings

- Plan earlier so that people can block their calendars
- Plan on movement (time & space)

### Ways to Reduce Distractions

- Support online participants in booking co-working spaces either near to their location that are equipped with necessary basic facilities such as internet, electricity, and work desks.
- Share comprehensive information about the available facilities and support resources and provide guidance on how to access them through facilitation documents.

### Communication Tools for Hybrid Collaboration

- Carefully select tools and technologies that consider inclusivity and the impact on teams.
- Avoid imposing unsutaible platforms on teams and be open to new options and tools.
- Ensure virtual meetings have the capacity to accommodate more participants.
- Follow up with remote attendees after hybrid meetings to address their needs.
- Set up and use proper microphone system for all the in-person groups, so that those joining remotely can .
- Proper shared note taking document and/ or facilitation guide for both in-person and remote groups to ensure both groups are included.
- Establish a platform for asynchronous side chat to facilitate communication.
- Ensure equal availability and access for both in-person and remote attendees in hybrid events.

### Social Networking during Hybrid Collaboration

- Recognise and address asymmetries in in-person and online settings to establish realistic expectations.
- Create opportunities for social interactions both online and in-person to balance out the challenges.
- Foster a positive atmosphere in-person and encourage an informal approach online to facilitate idea exchanges and connections.
