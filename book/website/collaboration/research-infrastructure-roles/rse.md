# Research Software Engineer (RSE): Overview

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are professionals who combine expertise in software development with an understanding of research processes.  
They play a critical role in creating and maintaining sustainable, reliable, and reproducible research software that underpins modern science and engineering.

## Who are RSEs?

RSEs are individuals who bridge the gap between research and software engineering.  
They may come from academic, scientific, or technical backgrounds and often work closely with researchers, data scientists, and infrastructure teams.

RSEs can be:
- Developers who create and maintain scientific or analytical software.  
- Researchers who focus on computational reproducibility and software quality.  
- Infrastructure specialists who support research computing systems and workflows.

Their roles often overlap with data stewards, system engineers, and open-source maintainers.  
Many start as researchers who realize that software engineering practices improve research efficiency, collaboration, and sustainability.

## What do RSEs do?

RSEs develop, maintain, and improve the software and systems used in research.  
Their work ensures that research software is **reliable, sustainable, and reusable**.  

Typical activities include:
- Writing and maintaining research software used in data collection, simulation, and analysis.  
- Implementing automated testing, Continuous Integration (CI), and release workflows.  
- Managing version control systems (Git, GitHub, GitLab).  
- Packaging, licensing, and documenting software for public use.  
- Promoting FAIR and open-source principles in research software.  
- Supporting collaboration between teams across different scientific domains.  
- Improving performance, portability, and maintainability of scientific codebases.  

## Qualifications or Skills

RSEs combine technical, research, and communication skills.  
Common competencies include:
- Programming (Python, R, C/C++, Julia, MATLAB, Fortran).  
- Testing, CI/CD, and software quality assurance.  
- Environment management (Conda, Docker, Singularity).  
- Documentation and knowledge sharing.  
- Licensing and open-source governance.  
- Version control and collaborative workflows.  
- Software architecture and design patterns.  
- Data management and FAIR principles.  
- Communication and cross-domain collaboration skills.  

> 💡 RSEs are not defined by a single job title or programming language — their shared goal is improving the quality and sustainability of research software.

## Challenges

RSEs face several systemic challenges:
- **Recognition and Citation** — RSE work is often invisible and not formally credited.  
- **Career Pathways** — Many institutions lack clear career frameworks for RSEs.  
- **Funding Continuity** — Short-term grants limit long-term software maintenance.  
- **Time for Maintenance** — Development is prioritized over documentation and upkeep.  
- **Cross-Domain Onboarding** — RSEs must adapt quickly to new scientific contexts.  
- **Sustainability** — Balancing innovation with long-term support remains difficult.  

Community initiatives such as the [UK RSE Association](https://society-rse.org/), [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/), and [INRIA RSE Network](https://www.inria.fr/en/research-software-engineers) are helping address these issues globally.

## Benefits

Strong RSE engagement improves:
- **Reliability** — Software performs consistently and is tested.  
- **Reproducibility** — Research outcomes can be verified and reused.  
- **Efficiency** — Automated workflows save time and reduce human error.  
- **Reusability** — Well-structured code can serve multiple projects.  
- **Reduced Technical Debt** — Maintained codebases are easier to extend and sustain.  

Institutions that support RSEs gain long-term efficiency, transparency, and competitiveness in research.
