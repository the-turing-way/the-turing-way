# Community Managers: Overview

Community Managers roles are well established in technical industry but only over the last years they have gained recognition within academia and scientific communities.
Often these roles may not be called community managers, but their responsibilities include establishing engagement, organising community spaces and events, supporting people through inclusive practices, developing and maintaining resources, growing and evaluating use cases and collaborating with people involved in research and scientific communities.

Community Managers main objective is to organise groups of scientists, researchers and/or patients and the public around shared research topics and objectives. 
They are often employed by professional societies, universities, research institutions, larger programmes, and non-profit organisations. 

Each role is varied but the main activities are typically focused around compassion, stewardship, and collaboration with the community: 
* Catalyse connections with all stakeholders
* Foster communities (integrating communities together)
* Linking the right people up together (based on expertise and interests)
* Active community member
* Communicating technical topics to non-technical colleagues and vice versa
* Encouraging high standards of reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science
* Creating sub-networks within the community around shared experiences, for example, such as an early career researcher network

The day-to-day tasks of a community manager could include: 
* Organising and hosting community calls

## What qualifications or skills do you need to be a Community Manager? 
The vast majority of community managers will have a scientific background that may include advanced degrees (at a masters or doctoral level). 
Many community managers also have a background related to the specific field or discipline they manage a community in, but not all of them do. 
If the community is associated with software or programming, it is common for community managers to also have some coding skills. 

There is no professionally recognised qualification or training course to become a scientific community manager, but organisations do offer training and resources to help support the professional development of people in these roles.
The values and approaches community managers bring to their roles are often the most important qualifications for success as a community manager.
