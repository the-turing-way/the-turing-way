# Community Managers: Overview

Community Managers roles are well established in technical industry but only over the last years they have gained recognition within academia and scientific communities.
Often these roles may not be called community managers, but their responsibilities include establishing engagement, organising community spaces and events, supporting people through inclusive practices, developing and maintaining resources, growing and evaluating use cases and collaborating with people involved in research and scientific communities.

## What do Community Managers do? 

Community Managers main objective is to organise groups of scientists, researchers and/or patients and the public around shared research topics and objectives. 
They are often employed by professional societies, universities, research institutions, larger programmes, and non-profit organisations. 

Each role is varied but the main activities are typically focused around compassion, stewardship, and collaboration with the community: 
* Catalyse connections with all stakeholders
* Foster communities (integrating communities together)
* Linking the right people up together (based on expertise and interests)
* Active community member
* Communicating technical topics to non-technical colleagues and vice versa
* Encouraging high standards of reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science
* Creating sub-networks within the community around shared experiences, for example, such as an early career researcher network

The day-to-day tasks of a community manager could include: 
* Organising and hosting community calls
* Onboarding new members
* Attending community leadership meetings
* Writing community reports or newsletters
* Maintaining and updating the community site 
* Posting on social media 
* Planning for upcoming community initiatives
* Running training courses & workshops
* Reading publications relevant to the community
* Managing membership lists
* Mentoring community contributions
* Creating informational materials to help the wider field or public learn about the community and their projects
* And a lot more!

## What qualifications or skills do you need to be a Community Manager? 
The vast majority of community managers will have a scientific background that may include advanced degrees (at a masters or doctoral level). 
Many community managers also have a background related to the specific field or discipline they manage a community in, but not all of them do. 
If the community is associated with software or programming, it is common for community managers to also have some coding skills. 

There is no professionally recognised qualification or training course to become a scientific community manager, but organisations do offer training and resources to help support the professional development of people in these roles.
The values and approaches community managers bring to their roles are often the most important qualifications for success as a community manager.

## Organisations that support Community Managers
The Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement ([cscce.org](https://www.cscce.org/) works to _"professionalize and institutionalize the role of the community engagement manager (CEM) within science."_ 
They offer training, co-created resources, research, and an active community of practice for scientific community managers to connect and support each other.
