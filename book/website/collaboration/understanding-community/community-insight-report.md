# Running a Community Insight Report

What is a community insight report? In this chapter, we use this phrase to refer to a report covering a single, well-defined community or project, that uses qualitative interviews of community members to draw conclusions about the community as a whole, and make recommendations on where it should go next. 

In this chapter we'll talk about identifying your goals for a community insight report, the benefits of conducting one, the considerations which go into the process of conducting the report, and the different ways in which these can be solved.

## Why do you want to conduct a community insight report?
The first and most important question to answer before you begin planning a Community Insight Report is why you want to run one!
As mentioned in the introduction to this [chapter](#cl-understanding-community), it is important to regularly check in with your community to understand your members' perspectives and goals, uncover issues early, and ensure that people are feeling a part of the community.

A Community Insight Report is a great way to do achieve all of the above, but you cannot possibly cover all the topics you might want to ask about in a single interview and different topics might mean you want to interview different community members. 
Defining the specific goals for the Community Insight Report at the beginning will help to guide both the interview questions asked and the people approached for interviews. 

To get an idea of what you would like to achieve through a community insight report, a good place to start are your project aims (read more in [xref#pd-checklist]). 
How could a community insight report support the project achieving these aims? 
Where are you currently stalled, or not making as much progress as you would like to? 
This reflection should give you some ideas about what you would like to get out of the community insight report, which will in turn guide the questions you ask.

## Considerations for a Community Insight Report
### What sources will you use? 
Although the main data source for community insight reports are qualitative interviews with community members, you might also want to consider whether you will also analyse other sources of community interaction data. 
This could be Slack discussions, GitHub exchanges, or community calls. 
This additional data could provide extra background context for your report, but you should also consider how to communicate its inclusion to the community, what their reaction might be, and the appropriate level of citation of this type of data in the report.
For example, people may reasonably expect that exchanges in a closed Slack group will not be directly quoted in a community report, but may feel differently about you utilising public webinars in a similar way. 

### What is the timeline?
Community Insight Reports are not rapid processes. 
Planning a realistic timeline 
### How will you tell people?
The overall process of running a community insight report 
### Who to include and how to approach them? 
:::warning
It's important to consider whether you should interview community members who have moved on from the project. 
They may be a valuable source of insights into what has worked in the community, and also what needs to change. 
However, many may prefer not to contribute if they have left the project, or may not have the time. 
You should also consider why someone has left the project and how that might affect their participation, and answers.

### How will you manage the data you collect? 

### How will you communicate the results of the report?

### Should the report be run by the community or by a third-party? 
There are benefits and drawbacks to both an internal and a third-party approach to running a community insight report. 

Firstly, using a third-party to produce a report typically requires funding, which may or may not be available for your community. 
It is also important to consider 
On the other hand, use of a third-party can offer some anonymity to participants which might encourage them to be more candid in their responses. 
The group is also likely to bring significant expertise in running reports 

### How will you act on the findings of the report?
