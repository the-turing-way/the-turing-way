# Running a Community Insight Report

What is a community insight report? 
In this chapter, we use this phrase to refer to a report covering a single, well-defined community or project, that uses qualitative interviews of community members to draw conclusions about the community as a whole, and make recommendations on where it should go next. 
In this chapter we'll talk about identifying your goals for a community insight report, the considerations which go into the process of conducting the report, the different ways in which these can be solved, and the benefits of conducting one. 
(cl-understanding-community-insight-process)= 
## Process for running a Community Insight Report 
* Agree goals for the Community Insight Report 
* Identify whether using an external organisation to produce the report is in scope 
* Outline timeline, data sources, communication and engagement strategy, data protection, and other considerations
* Develop interview guide
* Recruit interviewees
* Conduct interviews, making notes and transcribing where agreed
* Code the transcripts or notes to develop generalised findings 
* Produce a report summarising the findings

## Why do you want to conduct a Community Insight Report?
The first and most important question to answer before you begin planning a Community Insight Report is why you want to run one!
As mentioned in the introduction to this [chapter](#cl-understanding-community), it is important to regularly check in with your community to understand your members' perspectives and goals, uncover issues early, and ensure that people are feeling a part of the community.

A Community Insight Report is a great way to do achieve all of the above, but you cannot possibly cover all the topics you might want to ask about in a single interview and different topics might mean you want to interview different community members. 
Defining the specific goals for the Community Insight Report at the beginning will help to guide both the interview questions asked and the people approached for interviews. 

To get an idea of what you would like to achieve through a Community Insight Report, a good place to start are your project aims (read more in [xref#pd-checklist]). 
How could a community insight report support the project achieving these aims? 
Where are you currently stalled, or not making as much progress as you would like to? 
This reflection should give you some ideas about what you would like to get out of the community insight report, which will in turn guide the questions you ask.

## Considerations for a Community Insight Report

### Do you need ethics approval? 
A big question and one of the trickiest! 
Whether or not you need formal ethics approval for the production of a Community Insight Report may depend on the nature and composition of the community you are producing a report for. 
For example, an academic community based at a single institution might require an ethics submission, while a small, globally distributed project might not even have an obvious body to approve it. 
Regardless, the rest of this section contains questions and prompts to help you document the answers to various aspects of producing this type of report which you might need to cover as part of such a submission and which should be communicated to the community. 

### How will you tell people?
Communicating with the wider community about the process of producing a Community Insight Report is critical.
The exercise in and of itself can be a great community engagement strategy and you will need people to know it is happening if you want them to participate in the interviews.  

At a minimum, notice should be shared on standard community channels (newsletters, Slack, or GitHub, for example) to let people know that this work is going ahead, with sufficient notice to allow people to raise concerns or questions they have about the process. 
Ideally, people involved in the production of the Community Insight Report will provide regular updates across channels as the project progresses, including clear ways to get in touch with the project team and how to volunteer to be interviewed if that is part of the process. 
### What sources will you use? 
Although the main data source for community insight reports are qualitative interviews with community members, you might also want to consider whether you will also analyse other sources of community interaction data. 
This could be Slack discussions, GitHub exchanges, or community call notes. 
This additional data could provide extra context for your report and corroborate findings from community member interviews. 
However, you should also consider how to communicate its inclusion to the community, what their reaction might be, and the appropriate level of citation of this type of data in the report.
For example, people may reasonably expect that exchanges in a closed Slack group will not be directly quoted in a community report, but may feel differently about you utilising public webinars or GitHub data in a similar way. 

### What is the timeline?
Community Insight Reports are not rapid processes. 
Planning a realistic timeline from the beginning will help with communications and overall project delivery. 
This is particularly important if people involved in the project are volunteers, since they will be contributing to the process alongside their day-to-day roles. 
This can also support the communication around the work with the community, by providing milestones for when they can expect interviews to be completed and the report to be released. 

### Who to include and how to approach them? 
Depending on your goals and areas of interest for the Community Insight Report, you may wish to solicit interviewees in different ways: 

* **Identifying a list of potential interviewees at the beginning**
	* This is best for reports where you have very clear goals and defined populations of people who you know should be contributing their views (for example, members of working groups, leadership team, or contributors to a particular aspect of the project)
	* This approach does risk you inadvertently excluding people who have valuable insights to share and may come across as exclusive if only a small group of people is invited
  * If you use this approach, ensure you have a plan for reaching out to people who are less vocal in the project to ensure their views are also represented 
* **Asking people to nominate people who should be interviewed**
	* A great supplemental method for identifying additional sources from existing interviewees 
	* May risk sub-networks or groups within the community being overrepresented in the report 
* **Putting out a general call for interviewees to the community** 
	* The widest net is cast for contributors
	* This approach risks low response rates as people assume they are not the type of community member you want to speak to!
 * You may risk overrepresentation of people from specific subgroups or backgrounds within the project, which may skew results 

In general, it is best to plan to recruit using a mixture of methods, with a general call to the community highlighting the areas of focus, and specific invites to a cross-section of the community aligned with your goals for the report to ensure a diversity of participants, backgrounds, and roles. 

:::warning
It's important to consider whether you should interview community members who have moved on from the project. 
They may be a valuable source of insights into what has worked in the community, and also what needs to change. 
However, some may prefer not to contribute if they have left the project, or may not have the time. 
You should also consider why someone has left the project and how that might affect their participation, and answers, before inviting them. 
:::

The availability of participant reimbursement for the time spent interviewing should also be part of your communications about the process. 
Compensating people for participating may generate more interest across the community, but may also mean you have a less focused pool of interviewees. 
It may also not be possible depending on funding availability, geographic location of participants, and whether the community has reimbursement infrastructure set up. 

### How will you manage the data you collect? 
In most cases for this type of report, interviews are recorded, transcribed, and then coded to pool insights for the report. Select quotes may also be used to further illustrate and support conclusions in the report. 

However, this poses data protection and privacy considerations: how will interviewees data be kept private, or will you get their approval to publish transcripts alongside the report? 
How will you handle sensitive issues or code of conduct concerns which might arise during the interviews? 
How will you prevent or mitigate negative consequences for community members who raise criticisms or problems during the interviewing process? 
You will also need to consult national and international data protection laws to ensure that your proposed solutions comply with any regulations that apply to your community. 

These questions should be answered well in advance of the interviews commencing so that you can communicate the mechanisms in place to potential interviewees before they commit to interviewing. 
For more reading on this topic you can check out the [Data Security](#data-security) chapter in the Guide to Project Design. 

### How will you act on the findings of the report? 
A key aspect and central goal of many Community Insight Reports is generating findings which can be translated into concrete steps for the community and leadership to enact. 
It is best to begin planning how to respond to any findings as part of the initial planning for the report: will the leadership host discussion sessions on the findings, plan a series of pilots to address various aspects, or take another course of action? 

Preparing to take action from the beginning helps to ensure the report results in improvements and change in the community rather than simply being an end in itself. 

### How will you communicate the results of the report?
As part of deciding how to act on a Community Insight Report is also identifying a communication plan for the results. 
You can explore different options in the [`Guide to Communication`](#communication) or look at your existing communications infrastructure to see how it can be used to disseminate the report.
As a general rule however, you should consider utilising multiple options over a longer time period to ensure that the results reach everyone who might be interested in the outcomes.
For example, you might submit a presentation to a community conference, host a webinar, publish the report online, and share all of these via newsletters and social media channels active for the project. 

### Should the report be run by the community or by a third-party? 
There are benefits and drawbacks to both an internal and a third-party approach to running a community insight report. 
Third-party organisations are likely to bring significant expertise in producing these types of reports, and can help with producing interview questions that will bring the richest insights about the aspects of the project you are investigating. 
Use of a third-party can also offer some anonymity to participants, which might encourage them to be more candid in their responses, since they will be speaking to a comparatively neutral person rather than another community member. 
External organisations should also be well-versed in the data protection and privacy considerations that need to accompany these types of report. 

However, using a third-party to produce a report typically requires funding, which may or may not be available for your community. 
They will also need to spend time getting to know the community, or risk conclusions which lack naunce and historical context that may be needed to ensure findings from this process are relevant to the project and its goals. 
You may need to speak to several different organisations to find one which best aligns with your project values, subject matter, and goals.

## Benefits of Running a Community Insight Report
Producing a Community Insight Report is an excellent, if time consuming endeavour which can offer sophisticated insights into aspects of a community. 
A Community Insight Report can uncover impacts from your project that are not captured by quatitative or traditional metrics for scientific research (such as career impacts, unexpected applicaitons of work, new collaborations, and more). 

They can also be valuable engagement tools, leveraging the passion and understanding of community members to help guide future directions of the community. 
They are, however, a lot of work, so are best used as part of an overall community understanding or community health strategy that includes more frequent and less intensive measures of community health, impact, and success. 

(cl-understanding-community-insight-summary)=
## Summary

* Community Insight Reports are an in-depth look at your project community
* Interviewing project members both former and current can offer unique and surprising insights into the direction and needs of the project
* Aspects to consider carefully are the goals for the report, how you will conduct it, recruitment of interviewees, and how you will communicate and implement findings
* If funding is available, third-party organisations can offer a professional and neutral approach to the process, but may need support with additional context
* These reports are best used periodically alongside more frequent community measures that are less intensive to collect
