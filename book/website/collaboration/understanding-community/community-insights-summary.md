The table below offers a brief overview of some of the different techniques and methods you can use to assess your community. 
It is not exhaustive, and more contributions are always welcome. 

| Type of assessment | Methodology | Positives | Negatives | Resources |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |
| Community Insight Report    | Qualitative interviews + written report   | In-depth exploration of community perspectives; Rich insights; Good community engagement exercise in itself      | Difficult to scale to large communities; Can be difficult to get objective perspectives; Ethical questions about who participates |
| GitHub metrics    | Quantitative measures from GitHub or other repository   | Easy to measure, scales well, can capture change over time       | Capturing interactions which don't happen or are not reflected on GitHub | [CHAOSS Contributor Metrics](https://chaoss.community/kbtopic/all-metrics/)
| Community Survey | Quantitative survey using a survey tool or Google forms; | Can be relatively quick to put together; Easy to scale; Can be re-run and capture change over time | Requires specific skills to develop and analyse data; Online surveys have historically low response rates; May miss some nuances depending on questions included and their formats | |
| Community Events | Regular or one-off synchronous events; might be online or in-person | Useful opportunity to get ad hoc feedback; can be re-run; | Difficult to scale; risk of people self-censoring; can bias feedback to people who attend | |
| Feedback form | Open form to capture feedback on events, initiatives, or the project as a whole | Easy to scale; Can be reused; good for quick responses | Need for clear responsibility for checking the form nad incorporating insights over time; Biases towards people who complete the form (response rates can be low) |
