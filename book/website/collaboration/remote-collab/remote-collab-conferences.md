# Organising a Conference or Sprint

This document lists the various tasks for organising a longer event such as a conference or a sprint.
The tasks and responsibilities are listed in a chronological order and have been divided into "before", "during" and "after" the meeting.
Though created for longer events, these detailed task lists can be used for planning smaller events that have fewer logistical requirements.

## Before the event

The different subsections are marked as "Earlier-phase", "Mid-phase", and "Later-phase", based on their importance at the different phases of organisation.
A few subsections are marked as "Relevant for all phases", as those aspects should be taken care of in all stages of event organisation.

### The organising committee for the event

***Earlier-phase***
- To make organising truly inclusive, include different stakeholders from the community, organisation, and members from diverse backgrounds in the committee
