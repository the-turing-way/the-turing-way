# Creating agendas

In this section we will cover why you might want to use an agenda, how to structure the beinging, middle, and end of an agenda, as well as how you might choose to build off of that agenda for the next meeting.
Meetings can provide the center of a community connection through shared work and networking.
When you design an agenda for a meeting think about what you are giving to your attendees and what you are asking of them.

Agendas, used well, can help make your meetings more productive, transparent, and connective.
An agenda can help someone decide if a meeting is relevent for them or help them know what to prepare.
During a meeting an agenda can be a written agreement on what you are spending time on as a group, showcasing what the group values enough to spend time on.
Finally, if you combine an agenda with live notes, this can turn into a written record of what was agreed to or ideas that were explored that can be referred to in the future.



## The beginning

The begining of anything is critical.
Beginnings of agendas are connecting points, bridges from our everyday live into our collaborative working spaces.
The start of any meeting happens when the first person logs into the call or walks into the room.
Often the first person to arrive can set the tone through their greetings of subsequent members.

The begining of an agenda is commonly focused on adminstration and housekeeping tasks.
There are several conventions you can build off of here.
[Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/meeting-format/) uses ADMIN to open their meetings.

- **A**ttendence: Take attendence. Tracking who shows up into the space shows that you care folks show up. Over time attendence can also help you spot people who might have a high degree of enthusasim for the topic but low capasity for the meeting or work.
- **D**uration: How long is this meeting going to be? Less important with meetings which are associated with calendar events, this can still help remind everyone of time constraints and check to see if anyone has to leave early.
- **M**inutes: Review the minutes of the previous meeting can remind people of what was discussed and decided at the last meeting. This is particuarlly useful for meetings that are infrequent.
- **I**nformation: Make any FYI announcements. In some meetings the call for information can be a dedicated agenda item (see next section).
- **N**ext call: When are you meeting next? Now is a good time to pull out your calendars and pick a time! The end of the meeting folks may be running off to their next appointments so getting this out of the way at the start ensures that everyone is acoomindated.

Part of housekeeping is tending to the emotional wellbeing of the group.
Providing a space for each person to check in with "How are you showing up?" can help people show up as a complete person, provide an opertunity for human-to-human connections, and set asside outside concerns to focus on the meeting.
Folks sometimes have a hard time naming emotions and it can be helpful to link in a [feelings wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/) to help folks identify what resonates with them in the moment.
When starting this practice it's very important to be clear that "Pass" is always an ok response.
Emotional sharing must be at-choice or it edges into cohersion and abuse.
When used well this can be a powerful connecting tool for your team.

Finally review and consent to the agenda.
Make sure everyone knows what is going to be talked about and that the group is in agreement that this covers the needs of the group for now.

This opening typically takes 5 to 15 minutes.
New groups will often require more time in this beginning phase.

## The middle

This is the part that most people think of when the hear 'agenda'.
Generally items in this section will fall into three categories if the group is trying to come to a shared decision:

1) Sensemaking - What is the context and background that frames a decision? This is a shared experience. One person in the group might have a perfect understanding of the background and context, but if that is not shared and commonly understood, then as a collective the group has not engaged in sensemaking.
2) Formulation or brainstorming - What are ways we could address the decision in front of us? This is where we get to be expansive and throw idea's around. The goal of this agenda is not to get it 'right' but to gather all possible idea's about something.
3) Decision - What is the decision we are making as a group? This seems like an obivious topic but it's very easy for a group to leave a meeting with different understandings of what was decided. If a decision is made, say so, ideally in writing.

This is also a good place to check in on sub-circles or individual to-do items.
A committee has never done anything in the history of time, and a person has never done anything in issolation.
The work that you are doing is done by the members of your group.
By taking time to track progress you are both recognizing who is doing that work and providing social accountability for that working getting done.

Timing for these agenda items can be tricky.
As a new facilitator/chair/lead you will almost certainly put too much on your first few agendas, that's ok.
Timings are easier with experience.
As a general rule of thumb people at the meeting are there because they have something to offer, so agenda items need to have enough time for everyone to speak to the item at hand. 
Generally speaking 2-3 minutes per person seems to be enough to hear from everyone once on a topic, and topics that are particuarlly heated or with new groups may need to double this timing for a second round.
It's not uncommon for meetings to only have 2 or 3 topics on an hour long agenda, construct your agenda carefully.

## The end

The end of an agend is a place to lay the groundworks for the next meeting and reflective improvement of how the meeting went.

Groundworks for the next meeting includes both personal tasks and collectively give input on what the next meeting agenda might look like.
It can be a good idea to take a pause and let people write down and share the todo or action items they are taking away from the meeting.
This gives individuals a chance to check in with the group before they go off and do a task.
By asking "What should we be talking about in the next 2-4 calls?" you give everyone the opertunity to stear the direction of the team.
As a chair/lead this can sometimes be invaluable if you don't quite know what direction to take the conversation next time.

Finally closing with a reflective check out allows for ongoing improvement of the team.
This can be focused specifically on relationship building, "What new thing did you learn about someone during this meeting?" or improving process "What practice should we carry forward or change in future meetings?" or general reflective remards "How are you leaving this call?". 

## An example agenda

Writing manuscripts together is a very common academic exercise.
Below is an example of an agenda to support revision of a rough draft for a group of 6-8 co-authors.
You'll notice that each agenda item is labeled with what needs to come out of that item.

| Duration | Item |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 2 | **Opening** <br> * Review and consent to agenda <br> * Roll call <br> * Confirm notetaker & facilitator <br>* Confirm next meeting |
|   | *Notes here* |
| 3 | **Check in** - Showing up… [[https://feelingswheel.com/](https://feelingswheel.com/) excited, sick, tired, distracted,...] |
|   | **No notes during check in **|
| 5 | **Information** - Anything new that you’ve heard related to this group that you would like to share?|
|   |             |
| 5 | **Update** - Been done <br> *Round: Given the things you committed to last meeting (copy/pasted here) what is the status of each item? What should we pay attention to in our new read-through today?*]
| 5 | Review - Solo read through the current draft |
|   | **No notes**|
| 10 | **Formultation** - What needs to be kept moving forward? |
|   |             |
| 10 | **Formultation** - What needs to be changed? |
|   |             |
| 5 | **Decision** - What are you going to tackle between now and our next call? |
|   |             |
| 5 | **Check out** - What are you leaving this call with? [discovery, future work, feelings …] |
