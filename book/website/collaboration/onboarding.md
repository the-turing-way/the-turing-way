# Onboarding New Members

Onboarding is the process of welcoming new team or community members through a set of structured interactions and materials that supports their interaction with the project. 

As any initiative grows or welcomes new cohorts of membership, a thoughtful onboarding process plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy, active, and inclusive community. 

While these pages concern onboarding of members into collaborative data science projects, many of the principles are general and apply to _any_ group of people working towards a common goal.
