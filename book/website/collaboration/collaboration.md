# Guide for Collaboration

***This guide covers topics related to effective and inclusive collaboration.***

Data science is defined by its interdisciplinarity.
Our work can only reach its highest potential if there are diverse teams of people involved in designing and delivering the research or product.

Working in diverse groups requires careful thought and alignment around the shared goals of the project team or community.
There are also a number of logistical challenges to consider.
Finally, although there are some very powerful tools to support collaboration they can be a little hard to learn at first.
(We're a big fan of the distributed and asynchronous project management workflows supported by GitHub so we're particularly keen to help you navigate how you can use them to work with your colleagues and community members more efficiently.)

In this guide we prompt you to think of a few different questions before planning an activity that brings two or more team members together:

* **How**: Is this project developed following open source or [inner source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) practices?
* **Who**: Who are your community or team? Are you open to new members joining or would you prefer to work with a predefined group?
* **Why**: What is the purpose of this specific task? Why are these people coming together to collaborate as part of the broader project plan?
* **When**: Is the specific interaction you're thinking of best supported by synchronous or asynchronous collaboration?
* **Where**: Are your team connecting remotely, in person, or a hybrid combination of both options?

Once you have decided on the "how", "who", "why", "when" and "where" you can jump into our technical support chapters on:

* Using GitHub to allow teams to work transparently with each other without needing to be in the same location at the same time.
* Team and community building.
* Running inclusive events.
* Defining roles and responsibilities.

We also welcome contributions to this guide that help data scientists build their careers to incorporate more inclusive collaborative practices such as our current chapter on {ref}`leadership in data science<cl-leadership>`.
