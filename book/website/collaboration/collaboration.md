# Guide for Collaboration

***This guide covers topics related to effective and inclusive collaboration.***

Data science is defined by its interdisciplinarity.
Our work can only reach its highest potential if there are diverse teams of people involved in designing and delivering the research or product.

alt: An iceberg sitting in the sea with the image label above it saying there is more to collaboration than you might think. There is an arrow from the image label pointing to the larger part of the iceberg that is under the sea. A small part of the iceberg is sticking out of the water and has a few people sitting on it. This part of the iceberg is labelled with project related technical terms including the words different teams, common goals, exchange of knowledge and production. There are a few divers exploring the much larger part of the iceberg under the water. This part of the iceberg is labelled with community oriented collaborative terms including treat each other kindly, build diverse teams, code of conduct, inclusive workspace and explicitly open for contribution.
