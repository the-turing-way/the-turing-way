# Online Resources
This document provides valuable resources for you to implement in successful academia-industry collaborations. It offers practical guidance through a curated list of "Turing Way Resources" and explores relevant academic publications. Additionally, the document includes resources for writing case studies of such collaborations.  

## Academic Resources
The continual tension of rigour vs. relevance remains both the opportunity for new knowledge while also serving as one of the many reasons collaborations sometimes struggle to provide meaningful value. The following is a list of academic publication exploring the benefits and challenges of academic-industry collaborations.

## Case Study Writing
Case study templates are crucial for ensuring clear and consistent reporting of academia-industry collaborations. They provide a structured framework to capture key details and effectively communicate the project's goals, methods, and outcomes. Below are some resources from The Turing Way to help you effectively communicate your collaborations.

A case study writing template for industry-academia collaborations is currently being developed and will be shared here as a resource. This would then become the preferred case study reporting template when contributing to the [case study library](https://github.com/f-rower/the-turing-way/blob/Case-Studies-and-Best-Practices-in-Academic-Industry-Collaboration/book/website/collaboration/academic-industry/case-studies-and-best-practices/case-study-library.md)
