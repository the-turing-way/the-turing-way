# Creating Structure in Leadership

Projects without structure require some basic form of rules or governance to avoid what Jo Freeman calls [the tyranny of structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).

This term denominates the authoritarianism that results in human groups due to the lack of structure and rules. 

A way to fix structurelessness is by bringing some governance, policies, or rules in writing accessible to everyone.

Governance helps open source projects function, particularly during times of change.

This tutorial by Carol Willing on [Open-source governance and leadership](https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-willingc/) (supplementary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQjRnWVmL28)) is an excellent starter for learning more about forms and models of governance.

## Acknowledging all contributors fairly

Leadership roles come with enhanced visibility, thanks to the work of other persons. 

Consequently, leaders must give appropriate credit to those that make them visible and bear extra and often invisible responsibilities for the overall project.

For example, in _The Turing Way_, we have developed a detailed account of how we acknowledge different contributors and how contributors can highlight their work in a meaningful way for them (see {ref}`ch-acknowledgement`).

## Learning from mistakes 

> With great power comes great responsibility

We are all humans and make mistakes. Healthy leadership apologizes when they make mistakes.

A good leader owns their mistakes, takes responsibility for the harm caused by their error, make amends, and learns from mistakes going forward. 

A substantial component of visible vulnerability will only make leaders better. Genuine vulnerability builds trust.
