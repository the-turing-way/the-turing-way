# Important Features of Leadership

Leaders empower others to identify solutions and make their own decisions to address the challenges they face.
[Monica Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Cox), an awardee of Purdue University's Faculty Award of Excellent for Leadership, once called leadership as "the highest way of activism" ([reference](https://twitter.com/DrMonicaCox/status/1299346141386022913)).

This statement points to the leadership skill of involving the members of a group (that a leader aims to impact) in decision-making processes and not taking individual decisions for them ([reference](https://www.management-issues.com/opinion/6087/the-leader-as-activist/#:~:text=But%20when%20they%20use%20constructive,in%2Da%2Dlifetime%20act.)).
Leadership is different from operating individually, managing a task or administering a role in isolation.
It is about understanding and enabling the purpose of the project and process through which people within a team work with each other to reach the overarching goal.

With this basic understanding of leadership, we discuss some essential leadership features, in contrast to management, in this subchapter.

## Assigned Leadership

Like a project manager in a team-based research project or a tech company CEO, there are formally-assigned leadership positions.
A company CEO may undoubtedly have the power to make decisions to ensure that people in their team advance and complete their assigned projects.
 
However, such a top-down approach to decision-making is the characteristic of being a manager. It does not necessarily make them a leader. 
A good leader inspires their team members to make progress in their own right and be leaders themselves, which means leaders are not always managers. Ideally, leaders should not be managers.

## Emergent leadership

Leadership opportunities in the context of data science often appear in spaces where human interactions happen.
As soon as there is more than one person involved, for example, in a group project, community discussions, or collaborative events like hackathons, there is always fertile ground for leadership roles to emerge.

Such emergent leadership opportunities allow individuals to explore, learn, and exhibit leadership skills and ultimately become leaders themselves.

### Emergent Strategy for Open Leaders

Leaders don't come with fully formed strategies.
Often open leaders don't identify or call themselves leaders and don't likely intend to take on leadership roles.

This is where, emergent strategy help describe how open leaders can navigate their roles in the ever-evolving world of data science, research and open science communities.
We have mentioned [Emergent Strategy](https://adriennemareebrown.net/book/emergent-strategy) by Adrienne Maree Brown at the beginning of this chapter and recommend this as a practical handbook on mobilising communities, activism for social change and nurturing deeper kinder connections in our communities through open leadership. 

Emergence is when new ideas emerge with time in a project, a community and as a result of bringing diverse members/perspectives into the team. 
Emergent Strategy is to embrace the changes and evolve our planned strategy as leaders based on what seems sensible and needed to facilitate/guide/lead the team towards their shared goals.
A [summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/emergent-strategy-organizing-for-social-justice/) by Forbes Lab describes the emergence as practical instead of theoretical. Brown’s definition of emergence comes from Nick Obolensky: “Emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.” 

```{note}
Here are her core principles of emergent strategy:

* Small is good, small is all (The large is a reflection of the small)
* Change is constant (Be like water)
* There is always enough time for the right work. There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.
* Never a failure, always a lesson
* Trust the People (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy)
* Move at the speed of trust
* Focus on critical connections more than critical mass—build resilience by building the relationships
* Less prep, more presence
* What you pay attention to grows
```

## Leadership is Granted by Others

Outstanding leadership is often sought and studied because teams, organizations, and people work at their highest potential, building extraordinary results when following good leaders.
Yet, one main characteristic of leadership is that it is granted by others who decide to follow someone as a leader in a specific setting.
This means that even leaders with formal authority need to build trust and psychological safety within their team to earn leadership.
It also means that the ideal environment and culture is promoted for different members to take on roles that align with their skills and interest and be granted open leadership roles by the formal leaders or the other members of the team.

### Creating Structure in Leadership

A clear structure (often described with an [organigram](https://pingboard.com/organogram)) about different stakeholders involved in the project and how they influence the decision-making helps everyone influences how they work with each other.
Projects without structures can become a culprit and victim of, what Jo Freeman describes as [the tyranny of structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm).
This term denominates the authoritarianism that results in human groups due to the lack of structure and rules. 
A way to fix structurelessness is by bringing governance, policies, or rules in writing accessible to everyone.

Governance is the set of formal and informal practices through which an organisation sets goals, assigns responsibilities, establishes systems, and assesses outcomes of organizational action (find theoretical details in the [Handbook of Economic Organization by Grandori, A. (2013).](https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/elgeebook/14110.htm]).

```{note}
Organisations that have good governance use clear decision-making processes, behave openly by reporting on their activities, actively engage with their stakeholders, effectively manage the risks they face, and take responsibility for controlling and protecting their assets, including their reputation. Each of these areas of governmence activity contributes to an organisation’s success.

The governance process should help identify and create accountability for:
* who makes decisions, and how?
* who gets to participate, and how?
* who is responsible to address risks/challenges, and how?
* who controls and protects the outcome, and how?

Governance helps any team-led project to function well, particularly during times of change.
This tutorial by Carol Willing on [Open-source governance and leadership](https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-willingc/) (supplementary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQjRnWVmL28)) is an excellent starter for learning more about forms and models of governance.
We have also described governance in the different guides of The Turing Way, especially in the context of data science and open source projects.

## Leaders are Made, not Born

As with any other human aspect, leadership can be built and learned.

No fixed formula for leadership works in all scenarios with the same effectiveness.
However, individuals can learn some specific traits and adapt these traits as needed in a given situation.

Great leaders in one project or one environment, say a data science reading club, may not be leaders in other contexts such as leading a research project or the families' group at their kids' school.
Indeed, trying to become the leader of too many projects or in all contexts is often one of the aspects to avoid in healthy leadership as we mention in another subchapter {ref}(reference)<cl-leadership-avoid>.

No matter how many books about leadership a person reads or how many (often expensive) workshops a person attends to learn how to become a leader, no method will guarantee leadership at all times in all contexts.
Learning to become a good leader is a creative process that one can also learn through practice and willingness to learn from failures.
