## Summary
Academic-Industry collaborations can take many forms, but put simply they are when an academic institution or university collaborates with a corporation or business such as a pharmaceutical company, a consulting firm or a technology company. 

Whilst academia and industry are often viewed with having differing cultures, research aims and ways of working, there can be many advantages of bridging this perceived gap and working collaboratively. 

Some of these advantages include:
* Access to and leveraging resources on both sides, such as funding, research expertise and skills and real-world data
* Combining foundational research (often the academic focus) and applied research (often the industry focus)
* Accelerating innovation and societal impact through working together on a shared research problem
* Experience and increased career opportunities for students and researchers working as part of the collaboration

## Motivation and Background 
Academic-Industry collaborations are becoming more popular, with the [number of them more than doubling between 2012 and 2016](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/the-shifting-corporate-academic-relationship-in-pictures). 

We wanted to create a chapter as a starting point for those looking to set up an academic-industry collaboration, however a lot of the chapter content can be applied to any collaboration. 
Similarly, a lot of existing content in _The Turing Way_ also applies and we have signposted to this throughout. 
Many academic-industry collaborations are very similar in nature to academic research projects, with some small nuances that we have tried to capture. 
Overall we hope the chapter will give insights into how to set up for success in practice for a partnership between academia and industry, through navigating expectations, ways of working and bringing in elements such as community building. 

The basis of the following subchapters are mainly from the experience of the [Turing-Roche partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership). 
We would welcome any further input and content from other academic-industry collaborations.

In this chapter we are using the terms 'collaboration' and 'partnership' interchangeably but understand these may confer different meanings depending on the context.
