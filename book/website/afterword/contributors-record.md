### Kirstie Whitaker

* Role: Project Member - Lead Investigator
* GitHub id: [kirstiejane](http://github.com/kirstiejane)
* ORCID: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-4059)
* Short bio:
> I'm the lead of Tools, Practices and Systems research Programme at the Alan Turing Institute.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

* Personal highlights:
> I am the lead of _The Turing Way_.
> I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
> I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

* More information:
> I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
> I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
> But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
> Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance process that is inclusive and community-lead.

### Alejandro Coca

* Role:
    * Translation and Localisation Co-lead (2021-Present)
    * Book Dash Participant 2021, 2022
* GitHub id: [acocac](https://github.com/acocac)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-9264-1539](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9264-1539)
* Short bio:
> Alejandro completed his PhD in Physical Geography at King's College London in September 2020. He is currently affiliated as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Alan Turing Institute working on a project aiming to build and deploy open-source toolkits and demonstrators for Environmental Data Science. He is also contributing to `scivision`, a generic framework for scalable image analysis led by the Turing in collaboration with the open-source community.

* Personal highlights:
> I'm so glad to join _the Turing Way_ community. I've met a large and very active community contributing to a common goal, Open, Inclusive and Collaborative Science. My participation in the Book Dash 2021 was a fantastic experience to learn, discuss, collaborate and network with a wide variety of TTW contributors. My particular contribution during the 2021 book dash was to improve the documentation of translation within the Community Handbook. The documentation summarises learnings and experiences from the Spanish Translation team relevant to future translations.

* More information:

### Alexander Morley

* Role:
  * Core Contributor - Infrastructure Maintainer (2018 - 2019)
  * Previous Project Member
* GitHub id: [alexmorley](http://github.com/alexmorley)

* Short bio:
> I am a Mozilla Fellow (2018-) and a PhD Candidate at the MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit at the University of Oxford (2015-).
> I also receive support from the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship programme (2018) and Microsoft/Research Software England Cloud Computing Fellowship programme (2018).
> My undergraduate degree was in Medicine at the University of Oxford (2012-2015).

* Personal Highlight:
> As a core contributros I want to share "Why I care about the Turing Way?: When people don't use best practices in data science its almost always because they either don't know about them, or feel they don't have time. Advocates will tell people that the time is saved in the long-term, but it's a hard sell.
> By providing concrete, incremental, but authoritative, guidance I believe the Turing Way could provide the nudge that allows people to realise the benefits for themselves, and lowers the barrier for more researchers to acquire these highly valued skills.

* More information:
> I really want research to be accessible, but in a much broader sense than the word is often used. I would love to see a world where re-mixing research is a common thing, whether that be re-mixing figures to make them easier to understand, re-using data to generate new insights, or testing new methods to see how our theories might need to change.
> Slightly less on topic, but just as important, I am also passionate about the development and adoption of best-practices in governance. Safe and inclusive spaces are all too rare in academia, and I think some part of that can be solved by doing away with our laissez-faire attitude towards governance and management.

### Eric Daub

* GitHub id: [edaub](https://github.com/edaub)
* Short bio:
>Eric is a data scientist and geophysics researcher, has appeared on several television programs and podcasts to discuss his research on earthquake occurrence in the Central United States. One challenge for presenting earthquake research is the tendency to overhype results on the topic of earthquake prediction. Eric used these media appearances to highlight the difficulties inherent in predicting earthquakes, and explain why no reliable method exists to predict earthquakes accurately enough for societal actions to take place. From that discussion about overhyped results, he transitioned to explaining how his research showed that the chances of an earthquake had not changed due to recent changes in activity, as the fluctuations were *exactly* in line with what would be expected for a simple baseline level of risk. This outreach activity helped improve the understanding of the target audience on a complex, technical subject and debunk some of the commonly held assumptions about earthquake prediction and risk management.

* Personal highlights:
>I collaborated with a group of researchers from The Alan Turing Institute to draft a chapter of scientific outreach.

* ORCID id: [0000-0002-8960-9642](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-9642)
* Short bio:
> I lead a group on Open AI in Health at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich. I develop machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
> My passion for open and reproducible research has led me to join the Turing Way community. I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research), I support, teach and contribute to open projects such as The Turing Way.
> My work for the *Journal of Statistical Software* includes reproducibility checks. We only publish papers which are fully computationally reproducible. I also work on making our machine-learning software more user-friendly, reusable and extensible. Together with a PhD student I am thinking about how to
use data from hospitals to help doctors and patients find the right treatment
for each individual patient.

* Personal highlights:
> I work in data science and open and reproducible research are the things I think and
care about the most. So to me it only made sense to get involved. Plus: the community seemed
amazing!
> To me The Turing Way is a role model when it comes to collaborative,
distributed work. I learned so much just by participating in the book sprint
and seeing how Malvika, Kirstie and everyone else contributed to providing an
extremely welcoming and at the same time productive space. I took what
I learned and tried to apply it in other contexts such as teaching. I will
continue to do so.
> The Turing Way also inspired me to think about new ways we could teach people
about open and reproducible (data) science. I am currently thinking a lot about
how we could use the content from The Turing Way and turn it into a course.
This idea was also part of an application, where I proposed to start a new
group on *Open AI*.
> Specifically, I have co-authored these chapters: [Research Compendia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html), [File Naming Convention](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/filenaming.html), and reviewed many contributions.
> I regularly recommend The Turing Way as a resource. Both for learning more
about reproducible data science and also when discussing specific topics.
I think that people are taking it on and reading it :)

* More information:
> First, I would like to continue to help create content, review others content
and be helpful in any way I can. Sometimes I like to look at really old issues
and pull requests for example. Reviving such old, often almost finished bits,
is very rewarding.
> Apart from that I also have a bigger, long term idea for The Turing Way.
I personally am not a huge fan of reading. So books are not my favorite way to
learn.  In the past years I learned a lot by listening to others in talks,
podcasts, videos, and of course conversations.  So for me it is only a natural
next step for The Turing Way to become more than a book. It could be an
ecosystem, with the book at its basis. And -- if we decide to go that route --
I would like to be a part of it.

* GitHub id: [irenekp](http://github.com/irenekp)
* Short bio:
> I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Information Science and Engineering. While short, my journey with Data Science and Data Management has been varied and I've loved watching how a single concept can mould into so many different disciplines! I have been able to work with data science as an RA for a couple of projects that focused on different aspects of Social Network Analysis. I've also been able to follow data management and related practices during my internships at a fintech and a telecom company.

* Personal highlights:
> Turing Way was my first foray into Open Source, and I have found it extremely helpful in learning both about general github and open source practices as well as being part of a moving and collaborative community. I especially loved being part of an extremely multidisciplinary group of people, really shows me the real span of Data Science!
> The ethics book has been a great source of interest for me as it encompasses many of the issues I both grappled with, debated and deliberated upon extensively during my own data science projects.
> During my time working on the Data Anonymization Chapter (Issue: #1578 , Pull Request: #1579 ) I managed to read more extensively about anonymization and I found answers to many of the questions that had previously bothered me.
> I really hope that the work we've done here to consolidate all these ethical guidelines will help make practicing data science with a strong ethical basis and clear moral conscience more easy and accessible.

* More information:
> In line with my contributions so far, I am extremely passionate about working on an ethical framework for Data Science, seeing as a lot of it focuses on exposing patterns that could easily be invasive, I really think an ethical approach to it is the only way to keep practicing it sustainably in the long term.
> Science Communication is an other one of my key areas of interest, I've been combining it with my love for sustainable practices (be it data science or water resource management) so far to research upon and write articles that I hope would inform and educate more people! I hope to add Data Visualization to this combination soon!
> I intend to keep working at the cross roads of Data Science and Sci-Comm for the foreseeable future!

> I have a degree in Physics from Imperial College London, after which I joined the Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre at the University of Oxford.
> I worked on an interdisciplinary PhD project that combined mathematical modelling, cardiac electrophysiology and safety pharmacology, and moved over to the Turing afterwards.
> Since then, I’ve worked on a range of projects spanning synthetic data, data visualisation, and of course, the Turing Way!

* Personal highlights:
> I got involved with _The Turing Way_ via case studies of reproducibility in academic projects - essentially, I was a reproducibility detective during the initial phase of the project! :female_detective: The Turing Way was my first experience of working with collaborators from so many different institutions, and the community around this project has been a real highlight for me. My official time on the Turing Way has come to an end, but I still enjoy keeping in touch through the Book Dashes and other events.

* More information:
> As scientists, we share our work via papers and talks, but the intricacies of precisely *how* we implement an analysis pipeline or novel algorithm can be very difficult to convey in those formats.
> We're currently seeing changes in the default way we want to publish our papers through the open access movement, and I'd love to see a similar change in mindset happen about the data that we collect and the code that we develop so that others can reproduce, learn from and build upon our work.
> I want to ensure that the route to sharing these types of research output is open to everyone, regardless of their level of programming experience - the route might not always be straightforward, but it's a great opportunity to share and learn from our experiences!
> So many research projects now contain computational elements, yet it is easy to forget that not everyone has access to training in software engineering, or has a group of colleagues with such interests.
> If we say that we want people to make their research open and reproducible, we need to give them the tools they need to be confident in doing so.
> I see the Turing Way as the means of bridging that gap, by providing a friendly, practical and helpful guide for researchers at all stages of their careers.

* Short bio:
> I am a teaching fellow/Research Assistant in the School of Psychology at the University of Leicester. Before moving to the UK, I earned a MSc in Social Psychology and a PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences. I am interested in reasoning, judgment, and decision making topics and passionate about scientific communication and outreach.

* Personal highlights:
> In the **November 2020 book dash**, I used GitHub for the first time! I helped fix some small bugs (grammar and syntax, typos, formatting) and, I proposed two chapters on data visualisation and on study pre-registration.
> I started familiarising myself with the GitHub environment and learned how to collaborate through it to provide valuable contributions to the project. My work during these 5 days has mostly been individual, but I would really love to collaborate with others to work on the two chapters I suggested!
> In the **May 2021 book dash**, I was very happy to start where I had left off in the previous bookdash. I believe I made small but relevant contributions and I have a clear idea of where I would like to go next which is much more than what I was hoping for!
> In the **November 2021 Book Dash** (my third one!), I was invited to lead a discussion on data visualisation, which sparked a very interesting conversation. I also started a dedicated section in the book and I am looking forward to developing it!
> On November 25th, I will talk about my experience with The Turing way during one of the Leicester [ReproducibiliTEA](https://reproducibilitea.org/) meetings!

### Martin O'Reilly

* Role: Core Contributor (2019)
* GitHub id: [martintoreilly](http://github.com/martintoreilly)

* Short bio:
> I'm Principal Research Software Engineer and Deputy Head of the Research Engineering Group at the Alan Turing Institute.
> My focus is on using good software engineering practices to increase the impact of research software by making it reusable, reliable and robust
> I also have a strong interest in reproducible research, and am working to improve the tools and working practices at the Turing to make it easier for our researchers to work reproducibly
> I've moved back and forth between industry and academia over the years, gaining an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience along the way.

* More information:
> I feel strongly that researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the outcomes of their research are made available to all - researchers, practitioners and the public.
> These outcomes should be made available in a way that allows others not just to reproduce them, but also to re-use and build upon them.
> An awful lot of researcher and practitioner time is spent getting to the point they can usefully evaluate whether some research is of use to them, or in re-discovering unpublished negative results.
> This seems extremely wasteful and I'm convinced we can and should do better.
> In particular, I feel a lot can be done to improve the effective re-use of data produced by research projects.
> While there has been significant progress in recent years in the amount of data published alongside research articles, there is still a wide gulf between open data and re-usable data.
> In terms of research areas, I'm fascinated by the brain and especially the approach of understanding the brain by "faking it" (i.e. modelling and simulation).
> I'm particularly interested in robots as a way of embodying these models in the real world.
> I believe the Turing Way can impact positively in both these areas.
> By providing recommended working practices and guidance on associated tooling, we can make it easy for researchers to do the right thing.
> By publishing this with the weight of the Turing brand, we can apply social pressure for the adoption of these practices as new norms in the research communities we operate in.

  * Book Dash Participant 2020
* GitHub id: [paulowoicho](http://github.com/paulowoicho)

* Short bio:
> I am a Technical Writer / Google Season of Docs (GSoD) Participant working to make The Turing Way consistent, sustainable, and accessible.
> I have a BSc in Software Engineering from the American University of Nigeria. Thereafter, I worked as a Research Analyst in the Fintech & Innovation Division of Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria and helped to drive the Bank's push to become a platform by creating innovative digital products.
> I completed a Master's in Data Science from the University of Glasgow and starting my PhD in January 2021 studying conversational information-seeking systems. I spent two years as a Research Analyst at Guaranty Trust Bank in Lagos, Nigeria helping to build innovative digital products to meet the Bank's customer objectives.

* Personal highlights:
> The Turing Way is my first foray into open source and has been a fantastic learning experience.
> Not only have I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for how GitHub works, but I am also learning to prioritise sustainability and empowerment in the work that I do.
> Although The Turing Way is my first open source project, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learned a lot along the way. Before the GSoD program, I only used Github to 'store' my projects. Now, I am much more proficient at using Github for collaborative endeavours and I am more adept at working with tools such as Markdown, Jupyter Book, and Sphinx. In addition, I gained familiarity with setting up and working with web analytics software.
> You can see the full report from GSoD participation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/communications/GSOD-applications/GSoD-2020-Project-Report.md).
> The BookDash November 2020 was great! It was awesome to meet, collaborate, and share ideas with people from around the world. Beyond the Book Dash, The Turing Way is the very first open-source project I have ever worked on. The experience has been fantastic, and I intend to stick around as a contributor after the Google Season of Docs program ends. I also see myself getting involved in other open-source projects.

* Personal Quote:
> Asides technical skills, I developed a deep appreciation for what working on an open source project entails. My mentors helped me realise that the value I left behind from the GSoD program was not in the amount of work I did, but how I enabled other contributors to also do the work I was doing. As a result, I learned to contribute as a Technical Writer in a manner that was reproducible, sustainable, accessible, and inclusive.

> I try to help researchers make small improvements in making their research open, on the basis that some progress is better than none!
> Working in research data management I'm naturally concerned that data is not taken seriously as an independent research output and the reward system in academia is so heavily geared towards 'high impact' journal articles.
> As someone from a non-STEM background I'm also interested in how we can make reproducible research as accessible as possible. This will be the first project where I've worked directly in GitHub and I'm excited to get more confident in using it!
> I spend much of my time talking to researchers about the overarching principles of *why* reproducible and open research is a good idea and am excited by the idea of giving people practical guidance on *how* to do this.
> Messy code is frequently cited in these discussions as a reason for not sharing code so if we could produce something which helps people get past this barrier would be great.
> I hope that the Turing Way will be something we can also use at the University of Manchester and other Turing universities around the country!

One of Tim's proudest projects  was collaborating with Benjamin Mummery on a LEGO version of the Hartree Centre's iconic supercomputer [Scafell Pike](https://twitter.com/HartreeCentre/status/1189145621564968963)!

* Personal highlights:
>I collaborated with a group of researchers from The Alan Turing Institute to draft a chapter of scientific outreach.

- Short bio:
> Former software engineer at a startup and former actuary at an insurance company. My research interests are on the intersection of AI with different areas such as healthcare and finance as well as to improve their reliability and interoperability when being deployed. I am also more recently interested in open science, open source collaboration, and reproducible research. My current research work involves the application of deep-learning to develop novel predictive biomarkers of tumour response using real-world imaging data of soft-tissue sarcomas.  My research is funded as part of the international Sarcoma Accelerator, funded by Cancer Research UK, which will collect one of the largest repositories of multi-center sarcoma datasets.

- Personal highlights:
> Working together with the translation team (Batool, Iman, Alejandro), having interesting discussions with other participants of the Book Dash on different topics, contribute to the automation of the TW release workflow, meeting Batool again!

- Quotes:
> Memorable experience with the Turing Way and Scriberia!! Great to have a chance to attend the Book Dash and collaborate with so many talented individuals.

* Short bio:
> I'm a Data Steward at the Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Applied Sciences, in the Netherlands, where I support researchers with their data management and open science practices. For my PhD research, I analysed human teeth for their isotopic/chemical composition in order to say something about human mobility patterns (fields of forensics, archaeology, osteology). Next to the Turing Way I'm also involved with other teams, such as the [Open Research Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.org/) ([follow the calendar on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)), [IsoArcH](https://isoarch.eu/) and I was an [OLS3](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/) mentor! I'm also interested in anything related to physical samples in research, and I'm a co-chair of the [Research Data Alliance Physical Samples Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).

* Personal highlights:
> Thanks to the Turing Way I really learned how to work collaboratively using GitHub. The book dash in February 2020 was a great kick start to actually practice and directly apply these skills, which now allows me to contribute more confidently to other projects as well! I primarily contributed to the Reproducible Research Chapter, to the Research Data Management section, and to the Research Infrastructure Roles. I reviewed existing content and I'm working on adding a section on Data Management Plans and how to handle personal data. I also made a [The Turing Way poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4263403) that I presented during a conference. I hope to pay it forward and facilitate others in learning how to work with GitHub through The Turing Way or The Carpentries workshops. I'm very grateful to be part of this great and inclusive community!

* More information:
> I think scientific research should be accessible to anyone that would like to learn and contribute.
> I'm hoping to bring together specialists from my research field to establish guidelines for isotopic data from human remains and guidelines for how to handle and document physical samples.
I'm a co-chair of the Research Data Alliance group [Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig).
Please do get in touch if you work with physical samples and would like to get involved!
> I'm part of the Open Research Calendar Team.
This is a calendar that you can use to stay up to date with open research events, or add your own events to in order to increase visibility.
Visit us at the [Open Research Calendar Website](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/) or follow the calendar on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)!

* Quote:
> Being a part of the organising committee for the online Book Dashes was an exciting opportunity for me to look behind the organisation scenes and to be a part of an amazing team. The BookDashes themselves are absolutely amazing, especially the discussions and the 'show and tell' sessions!

## [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)

The Netherlands eScience Center is the Dutch national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. Their main goal is to enable scientists with varying computing experience to fully utilize the potential of the available e-infrastructure and allow them to achieve otherwise unreachable scientific breakthroughs. The Netherlands eScience Center is primarily funded by the national research council (NWO) and the national e-infrastructure organization (SURF) of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands eScience center maintains [its own guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) for reproducible software development. The focus of the eScience center guide has a big overlap with _The Turing Way_ and therefore it makes sense to avoid duplicating efforts. The eScience center contributes to _The Turing Way_ in the areas which are relevant for the eScience guide. The eScience guide points to _The Turing Way_ in when information would otherwise be duplicated.

Details of each members with their contributions have been listed alphabetically.

## [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/)

Under the collaboration name OLS-4 for Turing, _The Turing Way_ collaborates with [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org), a programme that helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors.
This programme is cofounded by Bérénice Batut, Malvika Sharan and Yo Yehudi.
This collaboration offers training and mentoring to interested members from Turing and The Turing Way communities to join the OLS programme individually or in teams.
They develop Open Science aspects in the projects that they either already have been working on or want to develop in the near future.

You can see the projects that participated in the second round - [OLS-2](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/) and the third round - [OLS-3](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/projects-participants/).
This collaboration was awarded the Turing Online Training grant to support Turing projects in the fourth round ([OLS-4](https://openlifesci.org/funders)) and share materials openly in the Turing training network.

## [Remote Computational Project Resource](https://isabelbirds.github.io/Remote-Computational-Project-Resource/welcome.html)

This resource was started by Isabel Birds during the COVID-19 pandemic to support students transferred from wet to remote dry lab projects at short notice.
This project includes links to (1) general tutorials for the complete beginner, (2) tutorials for specific analyses or pipelines, (3) free online textbooks, and (4) places to ask for help.

* Short bio:
> Isabel is a PhD candidate at University of Leeds working on dissecting the function and molecular evolution of long non-coding RNAs Supervised by Dr Julie Aspden, Dr Mary J O’Connell and Dr David Westhead.
> She has been interested in molecular evolution and the applications of bioinformatic techniques throughout her degree, and developed these interests while undertaking research projects in the Aspden and O’Connell labs.  
> She also has experience of scientific research from a funders perspective, gained during her year in industry and numerous summer internships with Yorkshire Cancer Research.

* Personal highlights:
> After learning about the Turing Way I was inspired to create a site aimed at a wider audience. The Turing Way tutorials helped me to set up my first Jupyter Book, helped me to create the site in a way that is open to contributions, and made sharing my work openly less scary! The Turing Way also pops up a few times in the resources listed.
> The aim of the resource is to make starting a computational project less overwhelming by curating links to tutorials and online textbooks. Skills such as file management or asking for help effectively are also highlighted, along with entertaining things like podcasts as a reminder that research can be fun!
