# Record of Contributors

Contributions to _The Turing Way_ may include but are not limited to, bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance.
We recognise all these contributions and acknowledge our community members fairly.
For example, using [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org) we update the contributors table with each person's name, where the emoji keys indicate the different tasks they have done (see the [README file](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md#contributors) and [](#contributors-record-all).

We understand that different contributions mean different things to people and may translate differently towards their personal interest, skill development, value exchange and advancement of their careers.
Therefore, we also offer  as a dedicated location to capture personal highlights from _The Turing Way_ community members.
