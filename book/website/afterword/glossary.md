Acceptance Testing
  A level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the project requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for the purpose.

Acknowledgements
  Where contributions to a project that don't qualify as authorship are written. It records the contributors name and the contribution that they made is described.

Add
  Command used to add files to the staging area. Allows the user to specify which files or directories to include in the next commit.

Adversarial Learning
  A process under which learning systems are exposed to negative stimuli, such as the addition of purposefully manipulated data samples, in order to obtain potentially-beneficial effects. Examples of this technique may include the addition of additional learning objectives which penalise unwanted characteristics of a learning system, for example the ability to distinguish between data records based on inappropriate demographic attributes.

Authors
  Authors in this context are the contributors to _The Turing Way_ project who have made a substantial contribution to the project such as writing a subchapter, facilitating community interactions, maintaining project’s infrastructure and supporting the participation of others through mentored-contributions. All authors are named co-authors on the book as a whole.

  A web-based service which allows users to upload and share fully-functioning versions of their projects in an environment they define.

Binderhub
  A service which generates Binders. The most widely-used is mybinder.org, which is maintained by the Binder team. It is possible to create other BinderHubs which can support more specialised configurations. One such configuration could include authentication to enable private repositories to be shared amongst close collaborators.

Continuous Delivery
  It automates and runs the steps required to build and test a project.

Continuous Deployment
  It automatically deploys each time a code change is made.

Continuous Integration
  It is the practice of integrating changes to a project made by individuals into a main, shared version frequently (usually multiple times per day). Also called CI.

Contributing Guidelines
  Guidelines outlining how a person should go about contributing to an open source project.

Contributors
  Everyone who has contributed something back to the project. These are members of a research project that have done some work that has made a contribution to the overall completion of the research. This could be a small contribution such as fixing a bug in software or a much larger contribution such as writing an academic article.

Corresponding author
  The person who administers an academic article for the research group. They are responsible for receiving the reviewers comments, the proofs, corresponding with the editors and their details are printed on the final version of the published article.

CRediT Taxonomy
  The CRediT Taxonomy is a high-level taxonomy, including 14 roles, that can be used to represent the roles typically played by contributors to scientific scholarly output. The roles describe each contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output. These details are becoming increasingly required by journals as well as authors meeting authorship criteria.

Data repository
  See repository.

Differential privacy
  A strategy to provide quantifiable privacy guarantees when working with datasets containing personal information.

An implementation of the Handle System, DOIs are in wide use mainly to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. However, they also have been used to identify other types of information resources, such as commercial videos.

Generalisable
  Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results.

Group authorship
  Some journals permit the use of group names but many require contributors to be listed and/or the writing group to be named. This is the same as shared authorship.

Human Readable
  A human readable medium or human readable format is any encoding of data or information that can be naturally read by humans. Some human readable formats, such as PDF, are not machine readable as they are not structured data, such as the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data.

Machine Readable
  Machine readable refers to documents, data or other digital outputs whose content can be readily processed by computers. Such documents are distinguished from machine readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. Machine readable data can be defined as data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.

repo2docker
  A tool to build Docker images from code repositories.

Repository
  *Same as Data or Code Reprository*. A long-lived place on the internet where resources (be they data, software, publications or anything else) can be stored and accessed. This keyword is often shortened to ‘repo’.

Robust
  A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.

Self Reflection
  Activity of thinking about our thoughts, feelings, emotions, behaviour action, and the reasons that may lie behind them. Taking the time for reflection we can grow our understanding of who we are, what our values are, and why we think, feel, and act the way we do.
