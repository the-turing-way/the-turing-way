# Working Groups, Funded Projects and Informal Initiatives

This page provides access to various group-based initiatives or subprojects, listed under three themes: working groups that guide the different areas of work as a formal part of Turing's governance, funded projects that are led by members in a paid capacity and informal initiatives that are led by members through collaboration around shared interests.
These subprojects are often time-bound and are supported by community members who take open leadership roles in response to the emergent and timely opportunities in the research and open science ecosystem.
