# Afterword

The last part of _The Turing Way_ book is called **Afterword**.
Following this design principle of standard books, we have so far included {ref}`glossary`, {ref}`bibliography` and {ref}`contributors-record-highlights` of the book as the supplementary materials of _The Turing Way_.

The community collaboration and development aspects of the book has been written into the [Community Handbook](../community-handbook/community-handbook) section of this book.
