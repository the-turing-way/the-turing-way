## Summary

We define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure people with disabilities are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research processes, communities and events.

Accessibility can also be understood as giving access to groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation, and in this sense, it overlaps with practices for inclusion. 
Indeed, accessibility practices originally designed for disabled people improve and enhance the participation of people with no disabilities.
This guide will focus in accessibility related to disabled people but will point out when these practices can be beneficial to everyone.

## Motivation and Background

Although disabled people are not very visible in data science, they are part of the community who experience barriers to full participation. Removing these barriers both improves the participation of these members and attracts new members to the field.
