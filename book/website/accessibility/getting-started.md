# Defining Accessibility

In this guide, we compile best practices and guidance for designing research projects by including different aspects of project management and (iterative) development practices derived from academia and industry.

Before starting a project, researchers must define the project's scope. 
Researchers should start by identifying the main questions they aim to address through their work. Scope definition also includes defining the project goals, possible outcomes, resources requirements, people involved (collaborators, users and target audience) and possible constraints.

Researchers can then proceed to identify the expected minimum viable product of their project, synergies with other projects (similarities as well as differences), measure(s) of success, and the overall impact they hope to achieve.
After these crucial questions are addressed, planning can focus on the operational aspects of the project, including ensuring that the project is usable and compliant with appropriate external guideline (for instance, ethics requirements and regulatory limitations). 

When designing a team-based project, it is important to think about all the skills required for the project and the resources needed to access those skills.
The project design also includes aspects such as timeline, budget, risks, expectations, resources for project management and preregistration of research protocols.
With these viewpoints, we welcome chapters defining the requirements in a project in terms of up-skilling, supporting and improving accessibility of different stakeholders.

We hope you will learn from different case studies for small, mid-size, and large projects spanning both short-term and long-term plans.
If you are brave enough, your examples of failed projects will be incredibly valuable for understanding how to avoid making the same (totally understandable!) mistakes again.

# Accessible and Inclusive Language

We aim to make the writing and editing process inclusive, accessible, and welcoming for everyone. Through inclusive language, we aim to avoid using words, expressions or assumptions that could exclude or offend anyone. 

These guidelines, inspired by Bristol University's [Style Guide](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/style-guides/writing/inclusive/accessibility-readability/) for inclusive writing, share tips for addressing language. 

## Making the Contributing Process Accessible

- Understanding the way in which cognitive load, processing disabilities, readability, translatability, and any other barriers may affect how resources are made and used across the process
- Describing images & illustrations (Scriberia)
- Understanding the way in which language is used
- Cognitive load & in context of processing disabilities
- Accessibility for beginners -> can link to Community Handbook (avoiding idioms)
- Translation & localisation 
- Writing good practices for data visualisation (not assuming particular IDEs, language-agnostic)

In general, we encourage an approach to Slack that is as accessible as possible, for as many people as possible. Please practice kindness when you communicate with others, and be mindful of cultural, linguistic, disability, and individual differences that may affect how people communicate online.
