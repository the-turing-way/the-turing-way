# Core Member Onboarding Checklist

**☀️ Welcome to *The Turing Way*!☀️**


This document can be used for people joining Working Groups or other key projects within _The Turing Way_. 

Here we are using "Core Member" as umbrella term for all community members who take on Maintenance Level roles within the community.

This may have included the following:
- Members of Working Groups
- Organisers of events such as Book Dashes
- Members in volunteer or funded roles leading on different initiatives

This checklist can be used by people onboarding new members to Maintenance Level groups/projects.
A dedicated meeting should be scheduled to thoroughly discuss roles and responsibilities, established ways of working, and other details, ensuring a clear understanding and alignment of expectations for the individual being onboarded.
