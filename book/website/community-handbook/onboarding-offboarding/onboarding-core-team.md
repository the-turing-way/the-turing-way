# Core Team Onboarding Checklist

**☀️ Welcome to *The Turing Way* Core Team!☀️**

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
This document was prepared and shared from 2022-2023 for 10-15 community members who were identified to have a leadership role within the community. At the time, this group was called the "Core Team" of _The Turing Way_, used as umbrella term for all community members who have taken on an maintenance role within the community.

This may have included the following:
- Chairs or co-chairs of working groups within the community
- Organisers of events such as Book Dashes
- Staff members of the Alan Turing Institute leading on different initiatives

This onboarding checklist is no longer in active use, it has been added to the Community Handbook for archival purposes.
