# Core Member Offboarding Checklist

ðŸŒ™ **Thank you for your contributions to *The Turing Way*.** ðŸŒ™

This checklist can be used when offboarding a member from Maintenance Level groups or projects.

A dedicated meeting should be scheduled to thoroughly discuss the handover of responsibilities and any other relevant matters, such as feedback for _The Turing Way_ governance.
This meeting should help ensure both the departing and remaining individuals feel confident and secure about the work being transitioned.

- [ ] Update [Governance Roles document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/GOVERNANCE_ROLES.md)
- [ ] Edit and update _The Turing Way_ chapters, especially in the Community Handbook, capturing your experience and insights that other members of our community can benefit from
- [ ] Remove access to Google Drive or other platforms where documentation, code or other resources are shared only with core members

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
This document was prepared and shared from 2022-2023 for community members who were identified to have a Maintenance Level role within the community, either transitioning out or stepping out of that role.
At the time, this group was called the "Core Member" of _The Turing Way_, used as umbrella term for all community members who have taken on a maintenance role within the community.
