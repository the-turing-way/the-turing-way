# *The Turing Way* Working Groups

A working group (WG) is an organised group or committee within a project, organisation or community.
WGs are formed for a specific purpose, such as addressing a need or opportunity identified in a project or a community. 
WGs are composed of individuals who bring their interests, expertise or willingness to engage with a specific topic or context within which the WG is formed. 
WG members collaborate to provide accountability, solve problems and make decisions to achieve the goals set for the group.
WGs scope can be a time-bound (short-term or long-term) or open ended based on type of tasks the group is assigned.

WGs are used across many sectors including government, academia, business and nonprofit or volunteer-led organisations to decentralise operations and decision making.
In open science, many communities carry out their work through established WGs.
Projects like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/governance/standing_committees_and_working_groups.html), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md), [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/process.php#wg-member-roles), [Sustain OSS](https://sustainoss.org/working-groups/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi) are few examples where WGs have been organised to ensure timely and open engagement with their community.

Within *The Turing Way*, WGs are formed by a small groups of people who work together on specific topics, themes, or types of work identified by community members as areas of interest. 
From the onset, different kinds of work in *The Turing Way* project have been led and executed by different groups of people.
For example, since 2020, localisation and translation work is being carrying out by a group international community members, who although initially worked in an ad-hoc manner, later were named and recognised as 'Translation and Localisation Team'.
Similarly, in 2021, after moving Book Dash as online-first event, a 'Book Dash Planning Committee' was convened yearly joined by a few previous attendees of Book Dashes who supported the planning and delivery of the event.
Nonetheless, formation of WGs had largely remained informal: after existing streams of work had been identified, community members engaged with the work were formally recognised and encouraged to develop ways of working that align with their needs. 

However, as the community has grown, we also recognise that the not creating explicit pathways for formalising WGs lead to [tyranny of structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm), where lack of structure leads to uncertainty of roles and responsibilities, which may work for few people who have been involved from the beginning, can ultimately exclude those who don't have direct contact with the project team.

In *The Turing Way*, the formalisation of WGs started in 2022.
The current research community manager of the project started their familiarity with the project through community mapping work in 2022.
The goals were to (1) formalise already existing and ongoing work within the community, and (2) support new areas of work that could address the observed and documented needs of the project and community.

We believe that everyone in *The Turing Way* community has expertise to share, and thereby anyone can join our project and community.
We describe different ways to contribute in our [contribution guideline](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Similarly, we encourage anyone who would like to join an existing WG to reach out to the specific chairs and leads of those group ({ref}`find details of our current WG<subprojects>`).
We have also been hosting _The Turing Way_ Community Forums where WG members share updates and provide resources for the community members to get involved ([recordings on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/theturingway)).

While anyone who joins *The Turing Way* can attend a WG meeting and join the WG, joining a WG is **not** a requirement for engaging with *The Turing Way*.

For informal groups that are interested in formalising their work, developing a working group offers an opportunity for groups to benefit from formalised support from *The Turing Way* team, as well as to openly get recognition for their work within the community.
However, there are a few requirements for community members to *create* a working group, process and documentation for which is provided in this chapter. 

With the documentation provided in this chapter, we want to ensure that sufficient support is identified and made available for WGs to sustain their efforts.
Furthermore, a standard approach for establishing and managing WG will allow that *The Turing Way* leadership abd project delivery team to provide the oversight and support needed to bring cohesiveness across all WGs and align WGs goals with the project's overarching goals.
Furthermore, the process described in this chapter provides guidance for how to ensure transparency and engagement with our community so that there is enough critical mass to establish, maintain and sustain a working group where necessary.

We also provide guidance and a template for interested members of the community to self-organise, incubate, maintain, and/or eventually sunset a working group. 
This document, as is the case with *The Turing Way* guides themselves is a living document.
Please help us keep this updated as the community and its governance evolves.
