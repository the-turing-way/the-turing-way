# Showcasing Natural and Engineering Sciences (NES) in _The Turing Way_

_The Turing Way_ provides an inclusive space for researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to collaborate on reproducible, ethical, and open research.  
This page highlights how members of the **Natural and Engineering Sciences (NES)** community can engage with and contribute to _The Turing Way_.

## Why NES and _The Turing Way_?

The Natural and Engineering Sciences (NES) are foundational to many data-driven and computational projects.  
By connecting NES researchers and engineers to _The Turing Way_ community, we can:
- Share reproducible research practices across scientific domains.  
- Learn from existing open science tools and community structures.  
- Build a bridge between national NES activities (for example, those in the Netherlands) and international open science movements.

## Relevant _The Turing Way_ Chapters

Several chapters align closely with NES disciplines and research practices:

- **Project Design** – supports planning reproducible experiments and engineering studies.  
- **Data Management** – covers FAIR principles, metadata, and reproducibility standards.  
- **Version Control & Collaboration** – enables collaborative software and experimental design.  
- **Ethical Research & Research Infrastructure** – important for responsible innovation and engineering projects.  
- **Reproducible Environments** – directly applicable to computational modeling and simulations.

These chapters can help NES researchers adopt open, transparent, and reusable workflows.

## Community Engagement Ideas

To strengthen the connection between NES and _The Turing Way_, the following activities can be developed:

- **Targeted Collaboration Cafés** — invite NES researchers to discuss reproducible workflows or lab automation.  
- **Thematic Book Dashes** — focus on data sharing in materials science, environmental modeling, or robotics.  
- **Shared Learning Events** — showcase open practices used by NES networks in the Netherlands and beyond.  
- **Domain-focused Writing Sprints** — co-create guidance for specific NES topics (for example, mechanical simulations, sensor data reproducibility).

## Connecting with the Community

To connect NES contributors already active in _The Turing Way_:
- Reach out via the [Gitter community channel](https://gitter.im/the-turing-way/community).  
- Introduce yourself during weekly Collaboration Cafés.  
- Look for contributors in the acknowledgements who are active in physical or engineering sciences.

If you know of NES-focused initiatives or networks (for example, NWO, DANS, or domain-specific data repositories), invite them to explore synergies with _The Turing Way_.

## Relevant External Resources

Some external resources valuable to NES contributors include:
- [Awesome GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/topics/awesome) — discipline-specific, community-curated lists of open resources and tools.  
- [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) — guidance for managing and sharing scientific data.  
- [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) — supports open access and research data infrastructure.  
- [Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) — connects international research data communities.  

Exploring these can inspire NES researchers to create or adapt open resources for their own domains.

## How You Can Help

If you are part of the NES community:
- Suggest relevant case studies, resources, or datasets.  
- Contribute your workflows and best practices to _The Turing Way_.  
- Help us map NES-specific needs for reproducible science.
