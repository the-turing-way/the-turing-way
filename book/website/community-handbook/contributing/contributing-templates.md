# Templates

In the `book` [directory](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book) of the _The Turing Way's_ Github repository, you will find a `templates` [sub-directory](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates) that contains templates for writing chapters and case studies.
Please use them to guide and structure your contributions to _The Turing Way_.

## Chapters

Chapters are _the_ building blocks of _The Turing Way_ book and each Guide in _The Turing Way_ spans several chapters that all explore topics under the Guide's overall theme.

Chapters, themselves, contain _sub-chapters_ that delve deeper into the chapter's topic, a _Checklist_ section that itemises action points for readers to take based on the key concepts from the chapter, and a _Resources_ section that points readers to other resources where they can investigate the chapter's topic further.
In addition, a chapter may contain a _Personal Stories_ sub-chapter that studies how an individual practices the chapter's topic in their work.

The [chapter template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates/chapter-template) is a great resource for designing and planning a new chapter.
It contains useful recommendations to structure your content and help you think about _what_ to write.

In addition, if you wish to revise an existing chapter instead, the chapter template remains a good point of reference to identify what sections to include or what a typical chapter in _The Turing Way_ should contain.

(ch-contributing-templates-casestudies)=
## Case Studies

In each Guide in _The Turing Way_, you will find a case studies chapter that contains a collection of case studies that each investigate how key concepts from the Guide relate to specific subjects.
These serve as relatable, real-world examples that help readers gain a deeper understanding of the concepts, tools, and practices introduced in the Guide.

Like the chapter template, the [case studies template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates/case-study-template) is a useful resource for writing and revising case studies in _The Turing Way_.
Please structure your case study contributions as per the template's recommendations that includes prompts to help you think about _what_ to write, as well as _how_ to write it.
