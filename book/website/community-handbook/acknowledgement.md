# Acknowledging Contributors

_The Turing Way_ is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners, educators, and other stakeholders.

Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.
We value all kinds of contributions in this project and are committed to recognising each of them fairly.

We recognise all kinds of contributions that are possible in this project.
We update our {ref}`Contributors Table<contributors-record-contributors>` by appropriately acknowledging our contributors' work within _The Turing Way_.
Furthermore, we invite every community member to update the {ref}`Record of Contributions<contributors-record-highlights>` with their personal highlights in _The Turing Way_ and use it for promoting their contributions to open science in general.

In this chapter, we provide details on the following aspects:
- who our contributors and community members are
- how we create opportunities for a shared ownership of this project
- how we can use the record of contributions to highlight the work of our community members
- what different types and possible pathways for contributions exist in _The Turing Way_
