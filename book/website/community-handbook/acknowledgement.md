# Acknowledging Contributors

_The Turing Way_ is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners, educators, and other stakeholders.

Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.
We value all kinds of contributions in this project and are committed to recognising each of them fairly.
