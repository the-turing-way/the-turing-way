### Day Lead checklist
**Note: The Zoom link will be made by the Book Dash Operational team, who will open the room at the beginning of each day. They will be able to pass on co-hosting rights as needed. Because the Zoom room will be made by an Alan Turing Institute account, alternate hosts that are not from the Turing are required.**

#### Primary Day Lead
- [ ] **Before** the day you lead
    - [ ] Check links on pad for each day to make sure the information is correct (links, padlets, Zoom links, discriptions, dates).
    - [ ] Check timetable times are up to date (including links to universal meeting times).
    - [ ] Post the day's sessions on Slack at the start of the day (remember, you can [time your posts on Slack!](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/201457107-Send-and-read-messages))
    - [ ] Find people to host each session on that day
- [ ] **During** the day you lead
    - [ ] Flag social session 
    - [ ] Check the day pad has correct information

#### Secondary Day Lead
The operational team currently acts as a back-up for the primary day lead. 
- [ ] Make sure that all the above tasks (for the Primary Day Lead) are fulfilled

### Session Host checklist
**Note: The Zoom link will be made by the Book Dash Operational team, who will open the room at the beginning of each day. They will be able to pass on co-hosting rights to the Committee and to Day/Session hosts. Because the zoom room will be made by an Alan Turing Institute account, alternate hosts that are not from the Turing are required to be added manually once the call has been opened.**
