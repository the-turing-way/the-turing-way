# Governance Guiding Principles: Inclusion, Transparency and Empowerment in Decision-Making

All *Turing Way* decisons should align with the following guiding principles:
1. **Empowerment** of contributors to participate in decision making processes and the community.
2. **Transparency** of ways of working and how decisions are made.
3. **Inclusion** of diverse perspectives in all areas of the project.

<!-- KW: We need a paragraph here that links to the purpose of The Turing Way and some of the existing content we already have!
Something more formal but along the lines of "This wouldn't be The Turing Way if we weren't considering how to ensure our own processes are collaborative, inclusive, ethical and reproducible! -->

<!-- Recommendation and insights from answering these questions can be shared in the WG charter document `reformat to reference!`. -->

## Empowerment

Our goal is to empower as many community members to participate as want to, and for decisions on a topic or subject to be made at the right level and by the right people.
Decision making within *The Turing Way* is most sustainable if the Working Groups and Delivery Groups maintain a networked relationship with the wider community.
The Steering Council members maintain their relationships with the wider community through their roles in Working Groups and Delivery Groups, as well as their role in constitutional level decision making. 

- What decisions does the WG feel *empowered to take as an autonomous WG*?
  - For example, the Translation and Localisation WG can choose the best platform for translating the book into different languages.
- What decisions does the WG want to *invite input* from the broader community?
  - For example, the Book Dash WG invites support from the community in planning activities for and evaluating past Book Dash events.
- What decisions should WGs *request support* from the community management delivery team?
  - For example, resource or support needed to execute a plan)
- What decision should be escalated to the leadership?
  - For example, the Infrastructure WG should propose the adoption of a new platform to the Steering Council, but as this change would have a long term effect on a large proportion of the community the decision will be taken at Constitutional level.

The open sharing of the working group's practices and progress can be maintained through engagement in various forms, including:
- Using Community Calls like the Collaboration Cafe for WG meetings, discussions, and/or ongoing co-working. <!-- KW: Add links - Note JD's recent questions indicating that the current invitations to the Collaboration Cafes aren't clear -->
- Hosting Fireside Chats and/or separate events on topics related to the WG activities.
- Documenting related practices and/or topics in *The Turing Way* guides, either in the Community Handbook or other ongoing guides within the project.
- Collaborating with existing WGs on projects related to infrastructure, accessibility, translation, or other themes. <!-- KW: Add links -->

<!-- Is this reciprocity? Or open sharing? Or both!? -->
All WGs should be represented at (such as through the WG chair), and contribute to the *The Turing Way* Community Forums (such as by sharing updates and inviting new members to participate in their work). 
Although it might not always be possible due to the time zones or other factors, all WG members are encouraged to attend these events.

In principle, primary decision-making should lie with the WG team itself. 
However, there will be some decisions that might require input from, or consultation with, the community level, other Working Groups, or Delivery Groups.
Some issues or proposals may need to be taken to the Steering Council for a decision, based on the principles set out elsewhere in this chapter. 

To identify where in their work a decision may or may not require inputs, support, or involvement from specific party outside the WG, we recommend WGs to use the following questions when creating their documentation, and invite clarity from the project delivery team:

- What decisions does the WG feel *empowered to take as an autonomous WG*? (for example, Accessibility WG develops accessibility guidelines)
- What decisions does the WG want to invite *consultation and support* from the broader community? (for example, Book Dash WG invites support from the community in planning their next agenda)
- What decisions should WGs involve *consultation and support* from the project delivery team? (for example, resource or support needed to execute a plan)
- What decision should be escalated to the leadership? (for example, the Infrastructure WG will need input and approval when starting a new platform)
- What other decisions would WGs want to make that don't fall under the above three categories?

In order to maintain transparency in decision making all working groups are expected to have a chair (or co-chairs), a secretary, and a paid staff liaison.
You can read more about these roles on the following page "Roles and responsibilities" `reformat to reference`

## Inclusion 

To identify information and knowledge a decision making group can actively share with the community, we expect the WG's charter to answer the following questions:

- How can community members engage or contribute to activities within the working group?
- Where would the WG activities benefit from input from the broader *Turing Way* community?
- What lessons from the WG should be captured in *The Turing Way* book to benefit the broader community?
- What progress has the WG made that should be highlighted, celebrated, and shared more broadly?

The open sharing of the working group's practices and progress can be maintained through engagement in various forms, including:
- Using Community Calls like the Collaboration Cafe for WG meetings, discussions, and/or ongoing co-working. <!-- KW: Add links - Note JD's recent questions indicating that the current invitations to the Collaboration Cafes aren't clear -->
- Hosting Fireside Chats and/or separate events on topics related to the WG activities.
- Documenting related practices and/or topics in *The Turing Way* guides, either in the Community Handbook or other ongoing guides within the project.
- Collaborating with existing WGs on projects related to infrastructure, accessibility, translation, or other themes. <!-- KW: Add links -->

In principle, primary decision-making should lie with the WG team itself. 
However, there will be some decisions that might require input from different people across the community, project leadership and/or project delivery team for consultation and support.

To identify where in their work a decision may or may not require inputs, support, or involvement from specific party outside the WG, we recommend WGs to use the following questions when creating their documentation, and invite clarity from the project delivery team:

- What decisions does the WG feel *empowered to take as an autonomous WG*? (for example, Accessibility WG develops accessibility guidelines)
