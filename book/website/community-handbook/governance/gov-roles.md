# Roles and Responsibilities

Everyone within *The Turing Way* community are responsible for adhering with our [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc) and our [Accessibility Policy](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3145).

Members of *The Turing Way* working groups or delivery groups are responsible for aligning these activities with our maintainance guiding principles <!-- reformat to reference --> of:
1. **Reciprocity** within and towards the broader Turing Way community.
2. **Open sharing** of practices and ways of working.
3. **Transparent and inclusive** decision making.

In this subchapter, we discuss the roles and responsibilities of members of a working group, delivery group and/or the Steering Council.
<!-- In the next subchapter you will learn about how to propose and manage a working group. -->

Specifically, we outline the responsibilities of: `reformat to references`
* Chair (or co-chairs)
* Secretary
* Community Management Delivery Group Contact
* Working Group members
* Invited experts

<!-- This content is really interesting but I think its in the wrong place... 
We provide example of structure and roles for different members in the WG.
However, please note that the roles suggested below are not meant to be permanent (for example, a WG chair should not be a permanent appointee), but rather a guiding structure that WGs can begin their work with, and then expand, remix, and reuse for their own purposes.
All roles may be temporarily appointments or long-term, as agreed within the WG.

One person may occupy multiple roles. 
However, one person should not chair multiple WGs, in order to enable diffusion of responsibilities and ensure representation of different members in leadership roles. 

Community members can join any number of WGs, however, we discourage joining more than one or two WGs to prevent over-extension of individuals within the community.

## Chair

The Chair of a working group, delivery group or the Steering Council provides leadership for the team and facilitates the sustained delivery of the purpose for which the group was created.
The Chair is responsible for ensuring the group's responsibilities are fairly distributed, and ensuring the broader accountability of the assembled group.

### Responsibilities

There are three dimensions of the Chair's responsibilities:

#### 1. Provide leadership

The Chair articulates a vision for the group and support all members, including new contributors, to make progress towards that goal through individual or group activities.

#### 2. Ensure the group activities align with *The Turing Way* code of conduct and corresponding guiding principles

The Chair works closely with the Secretary `format to reference` to make sure the meetings are planned effectively and conducted in alignment with the working group's charter.

#### 3. Contribute to the leadership of *The Turing Way* community

The Chair of a working group or steering group is a member of the constitutional level decision making Steering Committee for *The Turing Way*.
The Steering Committee has oversight of the long term strategy for the *Turing Way* community.
The Chair is responsible for sharing learnings and requests from the Working / Delivery Group to the Steering Committee, and for bringing back requests and guidance from the Steering Committee to WG / DG members.

### Sharing responsibilities

It is up to the Working / Delivery Group to determine if they would like to have one Chair or up to three Co-Chairs sharing the responsibilities listed above.

In *The Turing Way* we have found that having co-chairs works very well in distributing the workload.
For example, it can remove some of the meeting time requirements and provide more flexibility for meetings if members are connecting from multiple time zones.

We also acknowledge that there is additional work in sharing the responsibilities.
Two co-chairs do more work than one chair because they have to communicate and align with each other!

We encourage candidates to choose the best option for their personal work circumstances, and their preferred collaboration styles.

### Selection and duration in role

It is up to the working group to determine a process for selecting a Chair or Co-Chair.

It is up to the working group to set a specific time limit on how long an individual can hold the role of Chair or Co-Chair.

Please capture these decisions in the working group's charter.

## Secretary

> This text is adapted from the "What is the role of the Secretary" documentation in the [DIY Committee Guide](https://www.diycommitteeguide.org/) by [Volunteer Now](https://www.volunteernow.co.uk/) and is re-used under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike 2.0. `reformat to reference: https://www.diycommitteeguide.org/what-is-the-role-of-the-secretary/`

The Secretary supports the WG / DG in ensuring there is transparent documentation of the decisions made by the group.
They are also accountable for tracking communications to broader *Turing Way* community from the WG, although they do not have to take on these responsibilities individually.

### Responsibilities

There are three dimensions of the Secretary's responsibilities:

#### 1. Ensuring meetings are effectively organised and minuted

The Secretary works closely with the Chair to plan meetings.
They should give WG members sufficient time to add topics to the meeting agenda and circulate the agenda in advance of the meeting.

We don't require working groups / delivery groups to take formal minutes of the meetings but we do ask that they capture and archive notes for two purposes: 
- 1: to ensure members of the broader *Turing Way* community are able to participate in the activities of the WG / DG, including members of the WG / DG who are not able to attend synchronous meetings, and 
- 2: to meet our guiding principle of transparent decision making. `format as reference`

The Secretary keeps track of actions that have been identified and report to the WG / DG how they are progressing.
The reporting is valuable to the Chair in their representation of the WG / DG at the constitutional decision making level through their membership of the Steering Council.
The documentation also supports the WG / DG in keeping focused on their shared vision and goals.

#### 2. Document membership of the WG and track acknowledgement of their work

In *The Turing Way* we put acknowledgement of individuals' efforts and labour at the centre of our mission.
The Secretary is asked to ensure that there is an up to date record of membership of the WG / DG, including alumni members.
They are also asked to mentor members to regularly capture their efforts in the Contributors Record `reformat to reference: https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record` of the book.

#### 3. Track communication and correspondence

As a combination of the two responsibilities above we ask that the Secretary keeps track of outputs and communications from the WG / DG.
Their role is to ensure that the activities are not happening in a silo - meeting our guiding principle of reciprocity `format to reference` - and that the WG / DG members are appropriately celebrated for their efforts.

The Secretary may delegate this responsibilty to another Working Group member (a communications lead, for example).
This delegation should be documented in the Working Group's charter.

### Sharing responsibilities

It is up to the Working Group to determine if they would like to have one Secretary or up to three Co-Secretaries sharing the responsibilities listed above.

Prior to 2025, we had not formalised the role of Secretary within *The Turing Way*.
It may be easier for WGs / DGs to have one person who is accountable for these tasks and who delegates them to members of the WGs / DGs.
However, as with the shared responsibilities for Co-Chairs above `reformat to reference` individuals may find it easier to work as a small team to support the WG / DG in this role.

We encourage candidates to choose the best option for their personal work circumstances, and their preferred collaboration styles.

### Selection and duration in role

It is up to the working group / delivery group to determine a process for selecting a Secretary or Co-Secretaries.

It is up to the working group / delivery group to set a specific time limit on how long an individual can hold the role of Secretary or Co-Secretaries.

Please capture these decisions in the working group's / delivery groups's charter.

## Community Management Delivery Group Contact

We recognise that membership of a working group for any open source project is a lot of effort, time, and - in some cases - emotional labour.

Since the project began there has been at least one paid member of staff at The Alan Turing Institute working to support *The Turing Way* community.
The first dedicated Community Manager was Malvika Sharan who joined the project in November 2019.

The role of the Community Management Delivery Group (CMDG) contact is to provide administrative support to a WG / DG.
Members of the Community Management Delivery Group(s) are also well placed to maintain communications and knowledge transfer across the broader *Turing Way* community.

The CMDG contact may support the Secretary in note taking and archiving notes from the WG / DG.
They may also track communications or project management activities.

As paid members of *The Turing Way* project, the CMDG contact is well placed to triage decisions that can be made autonomously at the "Maintainer" leadership level, or need to be escalated to the Steering Council at the "Constitutional" leadership level.
They can help to scope and test ideas that are generated within the WG with other members of *The Turing Way* community, or raise suggestions from other WGs without waiting for formal leadership meetings and decisions.

### Sharing responsibilities

We do not anticipate having two people share responsibilities for this role as it will be held by a paid member of one of the Community Management Delivery Group members project.

If they are unable to undertake their duties for any reason (annual leave, sick leave, caring leave, work related travel) the CMDG contact is expected to find cover for their responsibilities from within the CMDG team.

### Selection and duration in role

The Community Management Delivery Group contact will be selected by the chair of the Community Managemtn Delivery Team in consultation from the Chair of the working group / delivery group.

There is no limit to how long this team member can be in this role.

## Working Group Members

Any *Turing Way* community member is encouraged to join a Working Group so long as they meet the membership requirements outlined in the working group's charter.
They do not need to take on a leadership role to join the WG.

Note that Delivery Groups membership is by invitation only due to the external accountability constraints placed on delivery group activities.

### Responsibilities

A non-exhaustive list of responsibilities for WG members of the WG is suggested below.
We expect these to be distributed across the membership in consideration of the individual member's interests and availability.

We encourage the WG to customise this list to best meet their needs and preferred ways of working, and to capture the WG specific responsibilities in the WG's charter document.

- **Provide specific expertise**, including identifying emerging challenges and opportunities.
- **Articulate and reflect the interests of community members** through community engagement across *The Turing Way* and with other communities.
  - There is great value and opportunity for working groups to convene conversations across communities and projects, building solidarity and sharing expertise rather than reinventing the wheel in siloed groups.
- **Review the WG's documentation and provide feedback**.
  - This responsiblility includes keeping the WG's roadmap up to date to meet the guiding principles of reciprocity and transparent decision making.
- **Attend WG meetings** and prepare appropriately to contribute to the agenda, particularly items with tasks assigned to them, including leading discussions.
  - This responsibility should be achievable for people who are not able to join synchronous discussions, potentially through engagement on GitHub issues or pull requests, or by reading and contributing to shared documents.
- **Communicate about progress** on actions assigned to them by the agreed upon deadline.
  - For example, this could include completing actions in advance of a meeting, sharing written documentation by a set deadline, or requesting an extension to the originally proposed timeline.
- **Support the distribution of information** to other WG members after each meeting and gathering information/feedback.
- **Identify opportunities to capture lesssons learned and best practices to *The Turing Way* guides**.
- **Represent *The Turing Way* and the Working Group in community spaces such as *The Turing Way* Collaboration Cafe and/or Community Forum, within other open research communities, and at external events.

### Selection and duration in role

It is up to the working group to determine a process for determining membership of the WG.

Please capture this process in the WG charter.

There is no limit to how long a *Turing Way* community member can be a member of a working group.

## Expert advisors

We encourage WGs to invite expert advisors to join WG discussions and activities on an ad-hoc basis.

An advisor will advise WG about key aspects of the project, provide a community perspective on key considerations, and be a sounding board for deliverables set within a WG.

### Responsibilities 

An expert advisor's participation in a WG meeting or asynchronous work may include facilitating specific conversations, providing feedback on specific piece of work or supporting WG towards building consensus among members on the desired project goals, building resources, sharing them openly and identifying risks or mitigation measures.

### Selection and duration in role

An expert advisor is not a member of the WG (although they could become one!)
It is up to the working group to determine how and when they invite external advisors.

An expert advisor is expected to join for a short and focused amount of time.
If they are providing sustained engagement with the WG we encourage the WG to consider them as WG members and acknowledge their participation appropriately.

## WG Charter

Each WG should develop a document that centralises information about the WG by providing the purpose of the WG, ways of working, different roles and responsibilities of the WG members, and anything a new member of the WG might need to participate.

We provide a {ref}`working group charter template<ch-working-groups-charter-template>` to help develop this document, which should be shared in the GitHub repository of the WG.

The group charter should provide, to the degree WG members are able to, the following information:

- **Purpose**: a clear statement describing area of WG's work
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: developed based on the guidance provided in this chapter
- **Infrastructure and Resources**: selected by WG to support their work
- **Guiding Principles**: suggestions are provided in the template document
- **Terms of Membership**: WGs can discuss and agree on appropriate terms and length of membership, such as for each role
- **Meetings and Communications**: details about WG meetings, suggestions are provide in the template document
