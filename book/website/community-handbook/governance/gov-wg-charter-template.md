# Template for a Working Group Charter

__*The template provided here is a revised version of the [Sample group charter provided by Collaborative Leader Network](https://collaborativeleadersnetwork.org/strategy-tools/sample-group-charter).__*
__*Working Group conveners should use this document to discuss different aspects of their work, build a shared understanding of the ways of working and adapt this document for their respective Working Groups.*__

## *The Turing Way* Working Group Charter: [GROUP's NAME HERE]

### Purpose

```
This section should articulate the purpose and needs co-developed by the Working Group.
It should also provide context for how the group intends to fulfil its purpose by addressing specific challenges and needs.
```

The [GROUP's NAME HERE] is a collaborative space for Working Group members to prioritize challenges, create a roadmap, and openly share them on GitHub repositories (such as issues on *The Turing Way* main repo or a dedicated repo for the Working Group).

The Working Group keeps the Steering Committee informed of its activities and invites their input or support when needed via its Steering Committee delegate.

Additionally, the Working Group engages with the broader community, inviting their participation in the Working Group and feedback on their work. This includes selecting the best course of action in the projects the Working Group undertakes. 
The Working Group also considers alternatives suggested by Working Group members, community members, and the Steering Committee in the context of community goals, current issues, concerns, and competing interests or preferences.

### Guiding Principles

- The Working Group members establish clear roles and responsibilities (read guidelines in {ref}`roles and responsibilities<ch-gov-roles>`).
- The Working Group chairs facilitate open and regular meetings to discuss agenda points invited from the Working Group members.
- In areas where the Working Group has decision-making authority, members will strive to reach an agreement by consensus.
- For decision-making related to agenda points or matters discussed in the Working Group, consensus-based recommendations and decisions are clearly communicated.
- In matters where consensus within the Working Group is not met, the broader community is engaged via the v's GitHub repository in a meaningful way to evaluate the proposed recommendation or decision. Community members are invited through other communication channels to share their feedback by commenting on the GitHub issue.
- Matters that affect the broader project and community are escalated to the project leadership and project delivery team to ensure their input on decision-making. Recommendations and decisions will be openly communicated.
- All decisions and recommendations take into account the timeline and available resources to support the work.
- If required resources are lacking, input and support from the Steering Committee are sought before making the decision.

#### Reciprocity and Transparency in Decision-Making

This section is developed using recommendations from {ref}`the WG Guidelines<ch-working-groups-guiding-principles>`.

```
Notes from how the WG operationalises reciprocity and transparency in decision-making.

### Terms of Membership

Community members agree to participate openly and responsibly until they are able to volunteer and stay involved in *The Turing Way* community.

```

```

Specific positions will be open in the WG if the post holder:

- can no longer serve in their role
- wants to take a break from their duty or leave the Working Group
