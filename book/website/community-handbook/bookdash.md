# _The Turing Way_ Book Dashes

_The Turing Way_ [Book Dash events](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash.html) are a less intense version of [Book Sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_sprint), where participants collaboratively work on _The Turing Way_ book synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date.
They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take the lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.

In the past, we have organised 1-2 day long Book Dash events in person or in a hybrid format, where one of the participants coordinated with their team remotely. 
However, to ensure that international participants have an equal chance to join and address the challenges of hosting in-person events during the COVID-19 pandemic, we started hosting Book Dashes virtually. 
These virtual Book Dashes range from two days to five days long, designed for flexible participation by members in different time zones. 
Meaning, rather than committing their entire working day, participants can choose one or multiple 2.5 hour short collaborative co-working calls, called "contribution sessions" each day based on their availability.
In the future, we will co-design hybrid events with an "online-first" approach for the Book Dash attendees who will have the opportunity to organise small local meet-ups for collaboration and social events.
