# Template for Drafting Newsletters

The template outlined below is what we have been using as a guide for collecting news items for _The Turing Way_ newsletters.
This template has evolved and in no way claims to be the 'perfect' format.
When reusing this template, you should experiment with what works for your community.
Your suggestions in the earlier subchapters are very welcome.

**Note:** Please view the template provided below in Markdown format but visiting GitHub repository where this file is located.

# Short yet descriptive title

`A sentence greeting the reader.`

- Short sentence about highlight 1
- Short sentence about highlight 2
- Short sentence about highlight 3

We are also sharing upcoming events, opportunities, and more! As usual, you can find more updates and opportunities in the 'Community News' and 'Opportunities in *The Turing Way* orbit' sections below.

To keep up to date with community events, you can also subscribe to our [shared calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=theturingway@gmail.com). 📅

You can keep up in real-time by joining our [Slack workspace](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack). Please also follow the project on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/turingway.bsky.social), or join us on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway).
