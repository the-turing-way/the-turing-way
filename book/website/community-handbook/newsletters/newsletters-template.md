# Template for Drafting Newsletters

The templates outlined below is what we have been using as a guide for collecting news items for _The Turing Way_ newsletters over the past years.
These two templates have evolved greatly over the years and in no way claims to be the 'perfect' format.
When reusing this template, you should experiment with what works for your community.
Your suggestions in the earlier subchapters are very welcome.
