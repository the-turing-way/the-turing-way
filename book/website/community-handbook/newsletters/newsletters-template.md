# Template for Drafting Newsletters

The template outlined below is what we have been using as a guide for collecting news items for _The Turing Way_ newsletters.
This template has evolved and in no way claims to be the 'perfect' format.
When reusing this template, you should experiment with what works for your community.
Your suggestions in the earlier subchapters are very welcome.

**Note:** Please view the template provided below in Markdown format but visiting GitHub repository where this file is located.

# Short yet descriptive title
