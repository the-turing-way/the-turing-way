# Formalising a Working Group

While any community member can join a Working Group, setting up a Working Group involves a few extra steps to assess both the need and interest in its development, alongside sharing more information with the broader community. 
This section is designed to guide the creation of Working Groups, from brainstorming to establishing structure.

## Should this Working Group be Created?

A few guiding questions that may help with the process of identifying if a Working Group should be created (or not!) are:

* **Establishing Need**: What need does this Working Group fulfill for *The Turing Way* community?
* **Establishing Requirements**: Does this topic or type of work require ongoing support, or can it be integrated into another format? (Should this be a Working Group, or can this task be accomplished in Collaboration Cafe?)
* **Establishing Membership**: Who would be a member of this Working Group currently (at the time of founding)?

### Establishing Purpose for the Working Group

To create a Working Group, its purpose must be established. 
This can be done independently, or through brainstorming with other community members. 
Establishing the purpose of a Working Group may require a series of brainstorming sessions and workshops, with various resources available to facilitate this process.

This process could also take place facilitated sessions conducted at a Collaboration Cafe, Community Forum, in dedicated meetings, or asynchronous discussions on GitHub.
Please reach out to the Steering Committee or Community Management Working Group if you have any questions about the process or would like support in getting started.

A Working Group will most likely focus on either:
1. A specific topic related to or of interest to *The Turing Way* community.
   * For example: localisation, professionalising research infrastructure roles, accessibility in open source communities and outputs.
2. A type of ongoing task or work currently being done within the project.
   * For example: Book Dash event strategy and delivery, open-source infrastructure maintenance, providing training and mentorship.
3. Any other aspect you would like to introduce to the community! `for discussion - is this true?`

### Proposing a Working Group

A short proposal should be created and shared as an issue on *The Turing Way*'s main GitHub repository. 
This proposal doesn't have to be exhaustive but must outline the area of work being proposed and where needs or opportunities have been identified in the project, community, or within the broader open science or research ecosystem of *The Turing Way*. 
Please identify and include at least 3 to 4 members who are interested in participating and contributing to the proposed area of work.

Ideally, the proposing party should discuss their plan with *The Turing Way* Research Community Manager or invite support from other members of the project delivery team.

Once proposed, the Research Community Manager will present this proposal to the rest of the project delivery team and share it with the community more broadly, inviting their inputs. 
The Steering Committee will discuss the proposal in the context of other Working Groups, feedback from the community, and ongoing projects. 
Feedback from their discussion will be shared directly on the GitHub issue. 

Based on the community feedback, the number of members interested, and feasibility for the work to be supported in *The Turing Way*, a final decision will be made and communicated by the Steering Committee with the proposing party.

### Approval for Establishing a Working Group

The approval process for a Working Group involves engagement from the wider community and the Steering Committee to understand what resources might be available in supporting the Working Group and if the Working Group's aims are appropriate for the community.

1. **Open Discussion and/or Q&A**: Discuss your idea in community spaces such as the *The Turing Way* GitHub issue, Slack workspace and/or Community Calls like the Collaboration Cafe. 
2. **Leadership Approval**: The creation of this WG must be approved by *The Turing Way* Steering Committee, either at a Steering Committee meeting OR in writing on the issue proposing the new Working Group. 

#### What's next?

Once approved, the Steering Committee will inform the group.
Research Community Manager and project manager will coordinate with the group to help them access existing resources they might need and create a public repository to capture notes and documentation from their work.
The Working Group's approval will be announced, and Working Group members will be supported in inviting more community members to their work, through promoting meetings and the public repository.

**Action on the group to completed a Working Group charter**: All Working Groups need to provide 'way of working' in their charter document.
We have provided a {ref}`Working Group charter template<ch-working-groups-charter-template>`, which should be filled through group meetings or asynchronously and shared openly on the Working Group's GitHub repo, inviting review and feedback from the community.

### Establishing Expectations for Working Group Members' Responsibilities

While the roles and responsibilities may shift or evolve during the lifetime of a Working Group, having initial discussions enables the group to work together effectively throughout the Working Group's duration.

* **Discuss Expectations**: Do all founding members understand the responsibilities (provided in the charter) to support a Working Group? Are all founding members aligned on the aims and goals of the Working Group? 
* **Discuss Founding Membership Roles**: How will this group distribute responsibilities among the roles listed above?
* **Discuss Working Styles**: Has the group collaborated previously? What working styles do people in this group prefer, and how does that affect the team's cadence, style, and communication?
    * Note: Team-building and/or facilitation can be discussed with and/or assisted by the core staff delivery team.
* **Discuss Previous Experience with WGs or Similar Organisational Formats**: What did you like about those formats, and what would you avoid? What kind of organisational histories do members of this WG come from?
* **Discuss Initial Goals**: Are there concrete goals that your Working Group would like to accomplish at its founding? Have these goals been scoped appropriately based on resources, availability, and interest?
    * Note: Frameworks like SMART goals, Agile, Kanban, Scrum methodology may be valuable here.
* **Discuss the Group's Communication Plans**: All Working Groups will have a GitHub repository in The Turing Way organisation to archive notes and track progress, but are there other communication tools you might need for your ongoing work (Slack channel, emails, social media posts on Turing Way accounts)?

### Logistics for Managing a Working Group

Once a Working Group has been established, it is essential to identify and discuss the following topics within your group to establish its cadence and momentum:

* **Establish Regular Meeting Times and/or Other Group Communication Needs**: How often should the group meet? Would they like to use an existing community call (such as Collaboration Cafe) for real-time discussions, or develop a separate call for co-working?
* **Establish a Timeline for the Working Group**: How long should this group be operational? Should it be time-bound or ongoing indefinitely?
* **Agree on Terms for All Roles**: How long should people be appointed in their roles, and how often should these roles change?
* **Use GitHub Repository for Organising and Documenting WG Activities**: All WG activities (including notes and the charter, mentioned below) should be archived in a Turing Way GitHub repository (you can use and adapt [this template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/working-group-template)).
    * Note: In {ref}`Working Group Resources<working-group-resources>` other infrastructure recommendations and needs (permissions, templates, and checklists) are available to help with this process.
* **Establish a Reporting Mechanism and/or Public Notes Archive**: Aside from archiving meeting notes on your GitHub repository, how else will you share Working Group progress with the wider community?
    * Note: All Working Groups should upload notes to their respective GitHub repository [in *The Turing Way* organisation](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/). For a template, please see this template repository.
* **Establish Appropriate Permissions for Accounts**: What accounts does this group need access to? Does this group have the proper account access and permissions to carry out its work?
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can assist with this!
* **Create a Working Group Charter**: Please follow the {ref}`Working Groups Charter template<ch-gov-wg-charter-template>`.
    * Note: All Working Groups should openly share an updated charter to their respective GitHub repository [in *The Turing Way* organisation](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/).
* **Create an Open Calendar Invite**: This may require support from a core delivery staff member to add the information to the public Google Calendar.
* **Advertise on Community Channels**: Use Slack, GitHub, social media, and/or the *The Turing Way* newsletter to share information about your Working Group.
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can assist with this! Ask them on Slack or tag them on GitHub to share out this information, or co-create a communication plan.
* **Create a Slack Channel for Collaboration** (not required but encouraged): Having an ongoing channel makes communication easier. What other communication channels might this group need?
* **Add Information about Working Group in Ways of Working and/or Governance Documents**: Is there a public and up-to-date record of this Working Group in the project's central documents?

### Maintaining a Working Group

While initiating a Working Group, maintaining its activities is integral for the group's success. 
On a quarterly basis, a Working Group should make time to revisit its structures and ways of working to ensure it is adhering to its established purpose. 

The following questions can guide this process:

* **Review Purpose**: Is this v still fulfilling its established purpose?
* **Review Progress**: Has this Working Group been able to make progress towards its stated goals? What adjustments, if any, should be made to support this work?
* **Review Process**: Is the existing way of working valuable for this team currently? Are there other processes (decision-making, conflict management) that may need adjustment?
    * Note: The Community Manager and/or Project Manager can assist with facilitating this!
* **Review Roles**: Is everyone in the group in a role they would like to maintain? If not, how should these roles change?

### Pausing or Sunsetting a Working Group

Deciding when to sunset a Working Group can be difficult. Often, Working Groups may continue indefinitely, but there are various reasons to consider sunsetting a Working Group:

* **Completion of set goals**: If Working Group has met their initially extablished goals and no longer to operate as WG, a WG can be closed.
* **Merging with other WG**: If a Working Group's work hugely overlaps with other existing Working Group's work, they may choose to merge the two groups into one group. If all members of one group decide to move to another group, they can formally close their Working Group (such as indicating the status on their repository).
* **Decreased capacity**: If there are no longer enough people to support this Working Group (for example, if the number of people in the Working Group decreases below two), then the need to pause or sunset a Working Group should be discussed.
* **Recommendation from project delivery team**: If the actions or projects related to the Working Group are not seen to be in line with *The Turing Way* project more broadly or if more time investment is expected from the project delivery team (including the Research Community Manager) to support the Working Group (due to reduced capacity or conflicting priorities in the project), the project delivery team may recommend pausing or sunsetting a project.
The Working Group may decide to pivot their scope or pause their work following their internal or a community voting process (such as via a public GitHub issue).
* **Disciplinary Action**: If there have been actions taken that may have broken *The Turing Way* code of conduct, the Staff Delivery Team and/or *The Turing Way* way co-leads reserve the right to retire the Working Group.
* Other reasons!

Once a group has decided to close down its efforts, the following tasks are the responsibility of the final members of the Working Group or a designated Steering Committee member:

* **Document Reasons for Closing Down Working Group**: Documentation is essential for continuous learning—for future and current Working Groups, as well as the wider community and ecosystem that *The Turing Way* feeds into!
* **Change Meeting Information**: Remember to cancel meeting invites and archive existing notes in the GitHub repository.
* **Update Documentation About the Group**: Change the information about the group's activity in all spaces where information has been documented.
