# Template for the Working Group's Charter

__*The template provided here is a revised version of the [Sample group charter provided by Collaborative Leader Network](https://collaborativeleadersnetwork.org/strategy-tools/sample-group-charter). WG conveners should use this document to discuss different aspects of their work, build a shared understanding of the ways of working and adapt this document for their respective WGs.*__

## *The Turing Way* Working Group Charter: [GROUP's NAME HERE]

### Purpose

```
This section should articulate the purpose and needs co-developed by the WG.
It should also provide context for how the group intends to fulfil its purpose by addressing specific challenges and needs.
```

The [GROUP's NAME HERE] is a collaborative space for WG members to prioritize challenges, create a roadmap, and openly share them on GitHub repositories (such as issues on *The Turing Way* main repo or a dedicated repo for the WG).

The WG keeps the project delivery team informed and invites their input or support when needed.

Additionally, the WG engages with the broader community, inviting their participation and feedback on their work. This includes selecting the best course of action in the projects the WG undertakes. 
The WG also considers alternatives suggested by WG members, community members, and the project delivery team in the context of community goals, current issues, concerns, and competing interests or preferences.

### Guiding Principles

- The WG members establish clear roles and responsibilities (read guidelines in {ref}`working-groups-guideline`).
- The WG chairs facilitate open and regular meetings to discuss agenda points invited from the WG members.
- In areas where the WG has decision-making authority, members will strive to reach an agreement by consensus.
- For decision-making related to agenda points or matters discussed in the WG, consensus-based recommendations and decisions are clearly communicated.
- In matters where consensus within the WG is not met, the broader community is engaged via the WG's GitHub repository in a meaningful way to evaluate the proposed recommendation or decision. Community members are invited through other communication channels to share their feedback by commenting on the GitHub issue.
- Matters that affect the broader project and community are escalated to the project leadership and project delivery team to ensure their input on decision-making. Recommendations and decisions will be openly communicated.
- All decisions and recommendations take into account the timeline and available resources to support the work.
- If required resources are lacking, input and support from the project delivery team are sought before making the decision.

#### Reciprocity and Transparency in Decision-Making

This section is developed using recommendations from {ref}`the WG Guidelines<ch-working-groups-principles>`.

```
Notes from how the WG operationalises reciprocity and transparency in decision-making.
