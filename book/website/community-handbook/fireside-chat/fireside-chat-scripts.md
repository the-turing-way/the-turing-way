# Fireside Chat Scripts

```{admonition} Note
:class: tip
These scripts were used to introduce Fireside Chats with _The Turing Way_ between 2022 and 2024, this documentation has been added for archival and transparency purposes.
Edits have been made for the March 2025 script.
```

## Opening the call

Before starting the recording, the call would begin with the following note:
```We are recording this session with transcriptions and it will be uploaded to Youtube afterwards. If you do not want to be on the video, please turn off your camera now.```

The script can introduce the member of the team starting the fireside chat, and more information about the event itself:
```
My name is [XXX]. 
I’m the [XXX] for the Turing Way - I’ll be kicking off this session to tell you a little bit more about this call, before we go directly to our panelmembers.
A few words about The Turing Way, it is an open source, open collaboration and community-developed handbook on data science.
Our goal is to make reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science possible - and to make it both accessible and comprehensible for everyone.
While I am kicking off the session today – I’m part of a wider team that includes XXX and others, many of which are here, and represent the wider & international community of researchers who have created this shared resource.

This Fireside Chat series itself has been an effort towards creating space across the open science communities - and indeed, the wider open ecosystem where people can gather and exchange concerns, explore challenges and share different practices that work in their contexts, to build allyship, and understand each other’s work and perspectives just a little bit better.

Today's topic focus particularly on "Nurturing Open Science in Challenging Economic and Political times".
How can Open Science communities thrive in times of austerity, with budget cuts looming around the corners and key values of Open Science, such as inclusion, being challenged and attacked.
Our speakers today will delve into these topics, first introducing themselves and their view of what Open Science is, as well as whether they have experience applying and receiving funding for their Open Science initiatives.
Before we start the conversation...

This script is used to introduce housekeeping needs before starting the trip: 
```
A few housekeeping things before we get started: 

Please note that we have a shared Etherpad to facilitate written note-taking and invite ideas from you, who have joined to listen in.
Please feel free to add questions and notes to the pad or the chat, and we’ll make sure to post them to be used after.

We have a code of conduct that applies to this event to ensure accessibility and respectful collaboration.
For any concerns, reporting of an incident that makes you feel uncomfortable at this call or further ideas to improve accessibility, please email theturingway@gmail.com.
More information on this can be found in the Etherpad.

The first part of the conversation will be recorded, after which we will hold the Zoom room open for an additional 30 minutes - for an unrecorded and more informal discussion, which usually ends up in an another interesting conversation!

```

## Closing the call

This script can be used to close the call, and the transition to a 30-minute discussion: 
```
