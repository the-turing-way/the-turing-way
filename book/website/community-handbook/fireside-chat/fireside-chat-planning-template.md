## Draft Meeting Structure: Co-designed with speakers

The **format of this session** will follow this rough agenda:

* Each speaker introduces themselves briefly and gives a **2 minutes pitch** covering their interests, experiences, concerns and insights related to the event's topic.
* Session chairs will state the question and invite responses from 1-2 speakers (the questions can be agreed in advanced) - there might be follow up question based on the response that we may not have discussed in advance
  * See below for rough format
* Chairs will make sure that all speakers have had the chance to speak (by responding to different questions) and express their thoughts or share resources from their work
* If time permits, we will take questions from the audience and speakers will be invited to address them. We will however invite attendees to use Zoom chat and Etherpad notes to share their thoughts.
* We will conclude the session with a final **1 minute pitch** as the take-home message by each speaker.
