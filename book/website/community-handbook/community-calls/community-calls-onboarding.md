#### **Welcome to The Turing Way!**

We're so glad to have you here! On this page, you can learn more about our Onboarding Calls, which have been initiated in 2024.

## About the Onboarding Call

Historically, onboarding in _The Turing Way_ community has happened through 1:1 connections, between the Community Manager and/or Community Leaders and prospective community members of the project. As the project has grown, so have the number of entry points: where folks may be interacting with different parts of project and community in a variety of different virtual spaces.

Starting in 2024, these calls are hosted every two months, where community leaders meet new members and create a space for them to connect with our community and available resources, ensuring they have the support they need to navigate and kickstart their journey with _The Turing Way_. These calls create an open space for questions, discussions, and a warm welcome into our community.

During this hour-long call, participants learn about _The Turing Way_ project in a group setting and how to contribute to different sub-projects and working groups within the community, and may gain hands-on experience in contributing to _The Turing Way_ guides (in some cases, even making their first pull request!). 

This is a space to bring your questions and interests â€“ we're so excited to meet you!  

## Agenda

As of January 2024, onboarding calls are being trialed using the following format:

1. Introduction, icebreaker (15min)
2. The Turing Way - What is it? (5min)
3. How to get involved with The Turing Way? (15min) 
4. Do you have any questions for us? (15min)
5. Feedback (5min)

## Want to onboard other community members? 

Please join the [#onboarding](https://theturingway.slack.com/archives/C06EVT7GKK3) channel on _The Turing Way_ slack! 

We would love to have more community members join in welcoming others to the community.
