# Community Share-outs

Community share-outs are a type of event or part of a call that are focused on sharing and celebrating the work of contributors.

In _The Turing Way_ we organise dedicated calls along with Book Dash events, our community's bi-annual contribution event.
On the last day of the Book Dash, _The Turing Way_ team along with the planning committee members host Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration sessions that are open to the public. 
The Community Share-out events provide a public platform to openly recognise the work of our attendees and community contributors.

For more information, read the {ref}`Book Dash <ch-bookdash-events>` subchapter.

## Celebrating Contributions

The Community Share-outs have have also been included as part of calls, such as Collaboration CafÃ©, to share and celebrate different kinds of work and contributions made by our community members.

### Formalising format of Book Dash Share-out (2019 - 2022)

From 2019 to May 2022, Book Dash Community Share-outs and Contributor Celebrations were solidified as a format for the final day of Book Dash.

On Day 5 of the Book Dash week, participants would share their progress and projects from throughout the week. The 1.5 hour call was facilitated by the Research Community Manager (RCM), and provided an important space to share and celebrate the many contributions that community members have made to _The Turing Way_ project over the course of the week.

In order to be as accessible as possible to different timezones, two Community Share-out sessions are organised on Day 5 of Book Dash, usually at 11:00 and 17:00 UK time. While subject to change depending on community needs, the agenda would roughly be as follows: 

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | ðŸ‘‹ Welcome & Check-in |
| 05 mins | Introduction to Share-outs |
| 45 mins | Individual share-outs - 5 minutes for sharing + questions each |
| 05 mins | Break |
| 30 mins | Individual share-outs - 5 minutes for sharing + questions each |
| 05 mins | Closing |

#### Book Dash Share-out format

In a shared etherpad and/or HackMD, contributors and participants from the Book Dash week are asked to share links to issues and pull requests that they had worked on throughout the week.

```
* Name:
    * Links to Issues and PR:
    * ASK:
```

This will allow fellow Book Dash participants and Share-out audience members to follow along remotely. Each participant is encouraged or asked to share their updates verbally as well during the call. When sharing their work, participants may share their screen, and/or talk through the contributions they have made throughout the week. 

Participants and audience members are encouraged to ask questions, and encouraged to end their presentation with an "ask" for the audience: a way they could help, contribute, review, or improve their work. Sometimes, there might even be a live merge during the Community Share-outs call! 

### Trialing Working Group Share-outs (2022 - 2023)

In parallel, while working groups were incubated and trialed across the project, it became clear that there was also a need to create spaces where work being done outside of the specific context of a Book Dash could be shared.

Because the Book Dash already assembled a critical mass of community members, working group share-outs (titled a "Community Call" or "Working Group Share-outs" while being trialed) were scheduled for the same day as the Community Share-outs. This call would take place between the two Book Dash Community Share-outs, usually at 13:00 UK time. While subject to change depending on community needs, the agenda would roughly be as follows: 

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | ðŸ‘‹ Welcome |
| 10 mins | Check-in |
| 10 mins | Governance Update | 
| 30 mins | Working Group Share-outs + Q&A (10min each) |
| 05 mins | Wrap up |

#### Working Group Share-outs format

Similar to the Book Dash Share-outs, in a shared etherpad and/or HackMD, working group members are asked to share status updates since the previous call.

Each working group was usually represented by one person. This person would share key information about the Working Group, such as its members, status, and key updates or bodies of work.

```
## Team or Project Name
* Group Members: X, Y, Z
* Status: Active, Inactive, Retired
* Key updates: Bullet points or general notes - can be explained verbally
```

## Separating Working Group Share-outs from Book Dash Share-outs (2024 - present)

In 2024, _The Turing Way_ delivery team is trialing the separation of Working Group Share-outs from the broader Book Dash Share-outs that occur at the end of the Book Dash week.
