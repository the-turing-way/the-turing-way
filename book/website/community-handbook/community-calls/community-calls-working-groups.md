# Working Group and Team Meetings

Working Groups self-organise meetings on regular basis and at their own discretion. The cadence (whether monthly or bi-weekly) is up to the descretion of the group. Many of the working groups also utilise the Collaboration Cafe as a space to organise and cowork on dfferent tasks.

## Active Working Groups

The following working groups are currently active across the project, with open meetings that anyone in the community can attend.
