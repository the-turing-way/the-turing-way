# Working Group and Team Meetings

Working Groups self-organise meetings on regular basis and at their own discretion.
The cadence (whether monthly or bi-weekly) is up to the discretion of the group.
Many of the working groups also utilise the Collaboration Cafe as a space to organise and cowork on different tasks.

## Upcoming meetings

You can see future working group meetings, and joining details, in the [community calendar](https://calendar.the-turing-way.org).
You can download the calendar as an [ics file](https://ics.the-turing-way.org) to subscript in your calendar app.
