# Steering Committee Meetings 

```{warning} 
These meetings are in a state of flux as governance is formalised.
The details here are likely to change rapidly.

## Steering Committee Meetings
In 2025, Steering Committee Meetings will be hosted regularly to formalise Constitution Level governance.
These meetings are attended by drawing from chairs and representatives of Working Groups and Delivery Groups (projects carried out in collaboration with _The Turing Way_).
These calls utilise prepared agenda items and particular issues to be voted on by different members.
The Chair and Secretary of the Steering Committee are responsible for scheduling and agreeing the agenda. 
They are accountable back to the community via {ref}`ch-community-calls-forums`.

These calls also faciliate decision-making in a more decentralised format, such as by inviting feedback asynchronously via GitHub issues/discussions from the organising body of an initiative (such as Working Group, funded projects or informal interest groups) within _The Turing Way_, relaying feedback from the Maintainer to the Constitutional Level, or the Community Level and vice versa (see: [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)).

All meeting notes are archived on the [`governance`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance) repository.
