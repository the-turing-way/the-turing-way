# Community Forums

Community Forums are our public-facing calls to share updates from across different levels of governance in _The Turing Way_.
Modelled off a political town hall event, these online sessions are an opportunity to better understand activities across the project and how decisions are made. 
Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community in reviewing our processes and recommend improvements. 
These calls are a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.
Community Forums are also used for getting new or returning community members informed, and actively involve them in discussing governance processes within _The Turing Way_.

Currently, these calls are hosted in English and recorded for use by participants. 
These calls also involve live discussion, screen-sharing, and other interactive activities that may be internet bandwidth-intensive.

## Format of call

The current format of the call is as follows, and will likely evolve as the community needs to evolve alongside them.

## Archived notes and resources

Collaborative notes, capturing feedback and highlights are archived on the [`governance` GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/blob/main/community-forum/README.md).
Slides are published on Zenodo and linked to the repository.
