# Maintainers Coworking Calls

_The Turing Way_ team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week.
These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1 hour long.
Since May 2020, these calls have been organised each week by different people from across the Maintenance Level groups.

Like Collaboration Cafes, we host these calls online using Zoom (https://www.zoom.us/).
We allocate two 20-25-minute Pomodoro sessions and breaks to chat about our work and exchange what we got done.

The primary target of these calls is members who are working on certain issues or Pull Requests in _The Turing Way_ to come along and join other community members in their usual working hours.
These calls also provide opportunities to clarify doubts about the project, get open Pull Requests reviewed, brainstorm different ideas together, and stay connected with other members in the community.

## Attending an online coworking call

The schedule for these coworking calls is updated weekly in the [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=theturingway%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
We announce these in our [monthly newsletters](https://buttondown.email/turingway/) and send a reminder on the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-2v7euwuo7-BYstHdKuTNd1ce0puDtBxA).

Though scheduled for 1 hour, you are welcome to join for shorter periods as your schedule allows; however, please let the host of the call know so that they know who to expect on the call.
If you are interested in coworking with one of the team members on a day that is not listed on the schedule, please contact them on Slack or by email so that they can find a common slot to work with you.

### Resource used for the call

The resource requirement for these calls is also very similar to the Collaboration Cafe.

1. Shared notes: [https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-coworking-call](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/ttw-coworking-call)
2. Online call by Zoom: The Zoom link is provided in the shared notes.
3. An online Pomodoro clock: [https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking)

We don't record these calls.
We also don't create {ref}`breakout rooms<ch-community-calls-collabcafe-breakout>` unless there are multiple people working on the same thing.

### Format of the call

We use the following schedule during each call:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | üëã Welcome |
| 5 mins | Introductions and personal goal setting |
| 25 mins | üçÖ 1st Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | ‚òïÔ∏è Break and report out |
| 25 mins | üçÖ 2nd Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | Open discussion and Close üëã |

In contrast to the Collaboration Cafes, the schedule for these calls seems more intense with less chance for discussion.
However, since these calls are attended by fewer participants, they provide more opportunities for informal interactions.

### Chairing Coworking Calls

Please update the document before each meeting using the following steps:

- Move the notes from the previous call below the template area
- Share the notes on Slack, announcing the dates and time
- Use the notes during the call to share information as you chair the call
- Make sure that you share the Code of Conduct link and use the shared web-based timer
- Create breakout rooms for people before starting the Pomodoro sessions, when needed
- As the first Pomodoro session ends, check if anyone needs any help or feedback, and then restart the second Pomodoro session
- The call is scheduled for 60 minutes, and hence can accommodate up to 2 Pomodoro sessions
- Close the call, thanking everyone, and archive the notes for the next call

#### Beginning

The call begins with the team members welcoming the participants, sharing the Code of Conduct, reminding them how to participate in the call, and setting the stage for everyone to share how they are doing and what they are working on.

#### Pomodoros

The session chair starts the [timer](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) to keep track of the Pomodoro sessions.
If everyone plans to work on independent tasks, we remain in the main room and work silently.
For any discussion or collaborative task that two people on the call are working on, we create [breakout rooms][ch-community-calls-collabcafe-breakout] for them.

If there are new members on the call, one of the members (usually the host of the call) takes the new member to a breakout room to show them around the project repository and share some tips for getting started.

#### Breaks

We take short breaks after each Pomodoro to reflect on what we could get done, troubleshoot any errors that any attendee might have come across, verbalise our progress and celebrate small successes.

#### If joining this call later

If you join later, you might see people quietly working on their tasks.
You can track the time left before the next break by opening the [shared clock](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) in your browser.
If you know in advance that you'd join later, you can let the host of the call know by either contacting them before the call or leaving a note in the shared document.
