# Community Forums

Community Forums are our public-facing calls to share updates from across {ref}`different levels of governance<fw-governance>` in _The Turing Way_.
Started in 2024, _The Turing Way_ Constitution and Maintenance Level groups have organised and hosted these community calls.

These open calls welcome our community members, project leaders, and anyone curious about the project, whether they are considering joining our community, using the book, or promoting our work.

## Background and Motivation

As our community has grown, the need for more formalised and transparent decision-making processes and structures has become apparent.
To further improve transparency and awareness of the diverse work within our community, we began hosting regular community-wide Community Forums, transitioning from the {ref}Core Team meetings<ch-community-calls-core-team>. 
 
These forums are designed to hold space to celebrate successes, discuss governance, share feedback, and provide opportunities to build connections with community members, other organisations and initiatives worldwide.

### Improving Transparency and Decision-Making

Modelled after a political town hall event, Community Forums offer an opportunity to better understand and communicate activities across the project and how decisions are made.

These calls also facilitate decision-making in a more decentralised format. 
This can involve inviting asynchronous feedback via GitHub issues or discussions from the organising body of an initiative (such as a Working Group, funded project, or informal interest group) within _The Turing Way_, relaying feedback from the Maintainer to the Constitutional Level or the Community Level, and vice versa.

Community Forums also serve to inform new and returning community members and actively involve them in discussing governance processes within _The Turing Way_.
Our aim is to leverage the expertise across the open science and data science ecosystem to review our processes and recommend improvements.

## Format

Following a more traditional meeting format, agenda items are prepared in advance of each call.

In a 90-minute meeting, the agenda allocates time for all three levels of governance with a focus on updates for community members and an opportunity to invite community members to vote or comment on particular issues via GitHub issues.

Below is an overview of what to expect in each Community Forum:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start (10 mins) | ðŸ‘‹ Welcome & check-in question |
| 15 mins | Community Level Breakout Discussion and Share Out |
| 15 mins | Maintenance Level Working Group Updates |
| 10 mins | Break |
| 10 mins | Constitutional Level Updates|
| 15 mins | Q&A from Community |
| 10 mins | Other updates and celebrations! |
| 05 mins | Closing |

Agenda items are collected based on important matters requiring community information, feedback, or identification of next steps.
Each Working Group is invited to submit a brief update on its respective work and present it to the community during the call.

A corresponding GitHub issue is created for agenda items to facilitate continued discussion beyond the call.

Presentations and discussions are conducted in English, and the calls are recorded for community access via YouTube.
These calls involve live discussions, presentations and screen-sharing, and interactive activities such as shared note-taking or breakout discussions.

### Hosting Community Forums

These calls are generally organised and hosted by the members participating in the Constitution and Maintenance Level groups.

A member from the Maintainer Level group is invited to chair each call, while the Community Management Working Group offers support with the logistics.

An issue with the [planning checklist for the Community Forum](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose) is created a few weeks before the Forum.
This includes guidance for setting up a Framapad for shared notes, a slide deck to guide the agenda, and a registration form to manage participation.

Draft from the previous meeting, linked in the archives notes (linked below), should be used as templates for setting future resources.

## Archived notes and resources

Collaborative notes, capturing feedback and highlights, are archived on the [`governance` GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/blob/main/community-forum/README.md).
Slides are published on Zenodo and linked to the repository.
