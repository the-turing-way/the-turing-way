## Summary

This chapter covers the motivation for translating _The Turing Way_ to other languages, some technical aspects about localisation and internationalisation, and the workflows to start a new language translation or contributing to existing ones.

alt: This illustration shows how global accessibility is reached through translation. A diverse team of three people are writing their contribution in each of the pieces of a puzzle. The pieces complete parallel arrows around the Globe. The arrows are labeled "Constantly updated" because this process is continuous.

(ch-translation-motivation)=
## Motivation

Translation is **a key step for internationalisation of _The Turing Way_** and any efforts in this regard are really welcome.
Having translated versions of _The Turing Way_ can open the channels for communicating between communities of practice around the world.
Translation is part of community building!

Potential translators are members of _The Turing Way_ community who would like to use the materials for teaching and communication and new members that are not yet part of _The Turing Way_ community but can contribute.

```{admonition} Remember
:class: tip
You do not need to be fluent in English to contribute to the translations, you only need to speak your own language.
```

The workflows for translation can become confusing at some times and many translation efforts go unfinished for many reasons.
Our aim is to provide clear documentation so any potential contributor is able to participate.
Any new member of the community should be able to step in, enter in touch with other members of the translation teams for their languages, and start helping to use the documentation.

In the next few pages, you will learn how open source projects are translated using translation management systems (TMS), how we organise our translation and localisation efforts inside _The Turing Way_, and how you can get started in translating _The Turing Way_ using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).
