**Development sessions**

Cuckoo clock: https://cuckoo.team/tw-bookdash

Each day we will hold 3 development sessions and an one themed discussion/networking session where you can interact with others, continue your disucssion outside development session or take a break as it's most sustainable and helpful for your participation.

Each development session will follow the Pomodoro technique that we also use for our coworking calls. We will use [browser-based shared (cuckoo) clock](https://cuckoo.team/tw-bookdash) to manage our time ([Coworking chapter in The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-motivation.html))

All time provided in London Time (UTC+1). Please use this link to convert in your time zone: convert time: https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/YYYY-MM-DD/hh:mm (update DD: date, hh:mm: hours:minutes)

**Use the Pomodoro sessions for comfort breaks as needed**
