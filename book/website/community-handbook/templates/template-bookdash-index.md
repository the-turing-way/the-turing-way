### Managing your contributions to the GitHub repository

The tl;dr version for easy reference during dashing:
1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues) or open a new issue referencing your addition.
    * The [issue template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new issue page, so all you need to do is edit the placeholder sentences.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Turing Way repository to your GitHub profile.
3. Make your changes!
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
    * Open a pull request as early in your contributing process as possible and add the label [WIP] to the title to designate "work in progress".
    * The [pull request template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) will automatically be rendered in the comment section of the new pull request page, so all you need to do is edit the placeholder sentences.
    * Add the ```book-dash-<location>``` label in the column on the right.
    * As you continue to make changes they will automatically be included in your existing pull request.
    * Change [WIP] to [Ready for review] in the pull request title when you are happy for your contribution to be reviewed and merged. :tada:

**What types of contributions can you make?**

* Reviewers for your Book Dash application have suggested a few specific topics for each of you
* You can also collaborate with others or start slowly by checking out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues)
* Proofread [existing chapters](https://book.the-turing-way.org) (check for typos, grammar, and links)
* Add further information to an existing chapter
* Suggest topics for new chapters (particularly if you can write them!)
    * A chapter can be minimum 3 paragraphs in length - what can you write 3 paragraphs on?
    * What skills or tools do you wish you had been taught at the start of your research career?
* Review ```[Ready to review]``` [pull requests](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pulls)
* Contribute to discussion in ```[WIP]``` pull requests and issues
* Incorporate case studies into the book
* Checklists for specific skill or recommendation
* Restructuring the chapter sections (like the Reproducibility chapter)
