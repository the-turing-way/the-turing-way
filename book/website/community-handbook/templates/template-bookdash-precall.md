:dart: Goal setting exercise: Breakout
---

We would like to help create some plans and topics they you would like to explore for your contributions in _The Turing Way_. 
- Please note that this goal setting can relate to the suggestions made the reviewers based on your application (see your acceptance email). 
- We will be delighted to work with you to make sure that you are excited about your contribution to the Book Dash event. 
- These topics can be something that is either missing in the existing chapters or need to be updated in the project.
- You personal motivation could also be to collaborate with others at the event to work on and support what they are working on
- We also recognise - and celebrate the fact - that plans may change once you meet the other participants!


Setting our personal goals will help us prepare better for your participation:
- **S**pecific: They precisely spell out what you want to accomplish and usually answer the 5 Ws (Who? What? Where? When? Why?)
- **M**easurable: They provide a specific indicator of success.
- **A**ttainable: They are realistic.
- **R**elevant: They are important and practical.
- **T**ime-bound: They specify a deadline for when the goal will be met.
