# Fireside Chat Template for Shared Note-taking

 Below we provide a template to enable shared note-taking during the event.
 We currently use [Etherpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etherpad) by [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://pad.sfconservancy.org), see this for example - https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-fireside-chat-mar2022.
 
 The choice of the platform is based on the accessibility aspect of Etherpad (web-based and screen-reader app compatible).
