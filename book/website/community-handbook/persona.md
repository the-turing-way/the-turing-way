# Personas & Pathways in _The Turing Way_

As a community-driven and open source project, we are aware that each of our participants will have different backgrounds, different cultures, different time zones, different levels of skills and very different lived experiences.

A persona is a detail of an imaginary user or member, based on real-world observations and understandings of existing members or potential future members.
It is meaningful when paired with pathways through which these personas engage with a project.

To understand how our contributors or users might interact with _The Turing Way_, we have developed some personas and pathways that we are sharing in this chapter.
They aim to capture different personas of the community members to explore how they come into contact with this project, how they continue to engage and how we can take their experiences and expectations into account when planning our community aspects.

If you would like to use this tool for your project, visit our chapter on {ref}`Persona Creation <pd-persona-creation>`.
