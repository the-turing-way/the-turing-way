# Onboarding and Offboarding

As a project, our goal is to provide individuals and organizations in academia, industry, government, and the public sectors the information they need to ensure that their projects are easy to reproduce and reuse. 

We encourage all stakeholders in data science to utilise _The Turing Way_ to understand their roles and responsibilities for reproducibility.

These onboarding and offboarding documents are living documents – as is _The Turing Way_ itself. 

As you will learn from being in this community: this is a constantly-evolving project that holds [emergence as a core value](https://hackmd.io/kVkwKSYuSLWWhLzlNSuT0g). In other words: as the project evolves – so will the team that enables its sustainability as a project.

Or alternatively, whether it's changed responsibilities, a new job, shifting interests, or any other reason –– we understand that life happens, and that communities will always be shifting and evolving! While we are sad to see you go for now, we hope that you'll stay engaged with us in *The Turing Way* community!
