# Drop-in Sessions

Drop-in sessions are an informal collaboration format where a team or group of people host regular opportunities for other people within the community or organisation to ask questions or start a conversation on a topic of their interest.

At the Turing, these include the [Turing Infrastructure Drop-in Sessions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins) (online and in person), the Turing Research Ethics (TREx) Virtual Drop in Session (online only), the Turing Skills Drop in Session (online and in person), and the Data Protection virtual drop in (online only).

These sessions typically include an online component, typically using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/). 
They may follow a different format or sign up person, depending on the needs and preferences of the organising team and the target community the sessions are designed for.

The primary goal of these sessions is to provide an opportunity for answering targeted questions on a subject that the team holds expertise in, such as data protection or research software engineering.
The sessions are a resource for community or organisation members to ask questions, receive targeted advice and support, and create space to start co-working or futher collaboration.
The sessions are also an opportunity to learn about and connect with new teams and individuals that an attendee may not regularly connect with.

One group is building a rocket ship, another group is fixing a car, and another group is working on a hot air balloon. In the central node, researchers are performing different tasks to build a robot. Some of researchers are taking the findings from the central node to the other nodes.

## Attending a drop-in session

For the Turing Infrastructure Drop-in Sessions, the schedule is regularly updated in a community calendar. 
This schedule allows multiple Turing teams to collaboratively host the session, including Research Engineering Group (REG), Research Community Management (RCM), Research Application Management (RAM), Research Project Managers (RPM), Citizen Science, Data Wrangler, and Trustworthy Systems.
The schedule also allows interested attendees to reference when to attend, based on the individual or team that is hosting on a particular week.

In order to sign up, an interested attendee will directly message the hosts for that session on the organisation's collaboration platforms, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or e-mail.
The hosts will then assign the attendee a 30-60 minute slot.

## Resources for drop-in sessions

The resources used for these sessions help facilitate coordination amongst the organisers and also to enable attendee sign up.

1. Online call by [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/): The Zoom link is shared on an internal Turing webpage and on Slack.
2. In person location (optional): A reserved meeting room or location at a shared organisation space
3. Online github repo: share information about the session, including [the schedule](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins/wiki/Schedule) and [how to sign up](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins)
4. Engagement and impact tracking resource: Sheet with information on the topics raised, next steps, and the overall impact of the session

These sessions are not recorded. 
Breakout rooms may be created if there are multiple sessions happening at the same time.
In that case, one host will stay in the main room to welcome new attendees and other hosts can meet with attendees in different breakout rooms.

## Format of the session

This format is drawn from the [Turing Infrastructure Drop-in Sessions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins) which uses the following format:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| 5 mins | ðŸ‘‹ Welcome attendees and assign slot |
| 30 mins | :speech_balloon: Slot 1 |
| 30 mins | :speech_balloon: Slot 2 |
| 30 mins | :speech_balloon: Slot 3 |
| 30 mins | :speech_balloon: Slot 4 |
| 5 mins | ðŸ‘‹ Close session |

Each slot may run longer or shorter, but the standard length is 30 minutes.
Multiple slots may run in parallel through breakout rooms.

## Chairing drop-in sessions

### Before the Session

- Session hosts can double check the schedule to make sure the correct information is documented for that session
    - Update host names and affiliations
    - Correct Zoom link and physical location of the session
    - Share session on Slack and other channels inviting attendees to the event
- Session hosts can coordinate amongst each other to schedule and assign slots during the session

#### Approaches to Sign ups

There are many ways to manage sign ups that occur before the call and during the call.
The best method will depend on the size of your team.
Sign ups are a way to approach scheduling different attendee requests
Here we share a few approaches, ranging from low touch to high touch:
- Attendees drop in at any point during a session. This may require them to sit on other conversations and wait to have their question answered.
- Allow attendees to sign up directly to fill open slots.
- Attendees directly message hosts who schedule them into open slots. 

When there are more requests than available slots, any additional requests can be accommdated through multiple breakout rooms (if there are more hosts available) or scheduled for a future meeting.

### During the Session

- Make sure there is someone monitoring the main Zoom room and physical space to welcome new attendees
   - It is especially important that someone is available before each slot to guide attendees to a breakout room, if those are being used 

### After the Session

Record notes for next steps and follow-ups in a shared document so that teammates can pick up conversations and collaborations in future sessions.
