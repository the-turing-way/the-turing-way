# Hosting a coworking call

This is a guide for hosting an online coworking call.
Examples are given for _The Turing Way_ coworking calls but are adaptable to any community projects.

## General Information

### Shared documents for agenda and Note-taking

Create a dedicated document for sharing agenda and encouraging collaborative note-taking during the coworking call.
You can find the template for _The Turing Way_ Collaboration Café and weekly coworking calls in the {cite}`template collection<ch-template-coworking>`.

### Video Conferencing

Coworking calls can be hosted via any online video conferencing tool such as [Zoom Conferencing Platform](https://zoom.us/) and [Google hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/).

Link to joining a coworking call should be included in the shared notes so that interested participants can find it easily.

In _The Turing Way_, we use Zoom due to its performance and security (waiting room option) features.
We ask our participants to create a free zoom account ([https://zoom.us/](https://zoom.us/)) and test that their headphones and webcam work ([https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test)) before they join the call.
