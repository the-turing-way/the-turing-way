# Community Calls

_The Turing Way_ community is distributed around the world.
To bring the community together, _The Turing Way_ has a variety of different community calls organised throughout the year.
These calls may vary from collaboration and working calls to organisational meetings, to public share-outs.
Due to the international nature of the project, these calls are generally organised online using a platform such as Zoom.

On each page of this subchapter, you can learn more about each type of community call.

It is important to note that not all of our community calls fit neatly into one category over another.
Some may mix practices and purposes (for example coworking as well as celebrations), while others may have a specific purpose (such as decision-making). 
All are meant to demonstrate our principles of being an open and transparent community.

Because of their scope and size, the [](#ch-bookdash) and [Fireside Chat series](#ch-fireside-chat) are documented separately.
However, those calls overlap with many of the principles and practices shared in this community call chapter.

## Joining Community Calls in Low-Bandwidth Environments

We understand that accessing online community calls can be challenging for individuals in low-bandwidth environments.

Here are some tips and alternatives for joining our calls:

- **Using Zoom App:** If you're experiencing low bandwidth on your computer (which could be due to high usage by multiple devices, and/or slow network speeds), turn off your camera, ask the host to ask others to turn off their cameras (especially when you are speaking) or consider joining the call using the Zoom mobile app on your smartphone.
The app may provide better connectivity and audio quality.
- **Calling In:** Zoom allows participants to join calls via phone call, which can be a viable option for those with limited internet access.
Check the meeting details for dial-in numbers and access codes.
- **Reducing Video Quality:** If video is not essential for your participation, consider disabling your video feed during the call to conserve bandwidth.
You can still actively engage in discussions via audio and text chat.

For more information on how to join Zoom calls see [the zoom support documentation](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060732).

We are committed to ensuring that our community calls are accessible to all members.
If you have any specific accessibility needs or suggestions, please reach out to us so we can accommodate them.

You can read more information on our access-related practices as a community in the [Community Handbook](#ch-accessibility).
