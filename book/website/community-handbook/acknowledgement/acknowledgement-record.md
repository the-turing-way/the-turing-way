# Record of Contributions

Two documents in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way) are used for creating a record of contributions in _The Turing Way_: Contributors Table in the [`README`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) file, and [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) file.
This record is made available in the afterword of this book as {ref}`Contributors<contributors-record-contributors>` and {ref}`Personal Highlights<contributors-record-highlights>`.
These documents can be used for highlighting skills that our members have gained and shared through their involvement in _The Turing Way_.

We invite all our members to co-create this record to capture the important work they do around answering questions, representing the project, developing and maintaining the infrastructure, and all other nurturing roles that make The Turing Way community so special.

The process of developing this record is described below in detail.

## 1. Contributors Table

The [Contributors](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way#contributors) table in [`README`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/README.md) file is updated with every contributor's name using the [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/)'s [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

No contribution is too small, and these emojis allow us to recognise and fairly acknowledging all kinds of contributions our community members make to the project.
Those contributions can include (but are not limited to) bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance.
Please see the subchapter {ref}`Acknowledgement Examples <ch-acknowledgement-examples>` for details.

## 2. Contributors file

The contributors file, called [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) in the GitHub repository, will hold specific details provided by community members regarding their involvements in the project.
This will be referred to as `contributor's detail` in the rest of this document:

> `Contributor's name`
> * Role: `This is an optional entry for any specific role contributors have assumed in the project. It is also a place to mention the date/year since a contributor has taken this role. Examples, "Core contributor (2018-present)", Translation lead (2020), or Code of Conduct committee member (2019-2020).`
> * GitHub id: `GitHub id, example: [@kirstiejane](http://github.com/kirstiejane)`
> * ORCID: `ORCID id of the contributor, example: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-4059)`
> * Short Bio: `1-2 sentences about themselves`

Then, our contributors will add "Personal highlights", which will hold details of their contributions to _The Turing way_:
> * Personal highlights: `GitHub contributions, PRs and issues. Further details have been discussed below.`

Additionally, contributors can opt to add more information they think can help them share their work and engagement with _The Turing Way_ project by supplementing "More information":
> * More information: `Additional information provided by the contributors. This is optional.`

### Personal highlights

Specifications for all types of contributions made towards _The Turing Way_ can be added in the [contributors file](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) as personal highlights.

These highlights can be individually decided by the contributors to record what they consider to be their significant and useful for their personal profile.
This can be supplemented with supporting materials such links to chapters, pull request, issues, and blog posts.

This record can be directly translated towards the professional development of our community members, which can be further used for enhancing their personal or professional portfolio (profile, CV, resume) (see the [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/edit/acknowledging-contributors/contributors.md) file).

_The Turing Way_ was originally funded by a [Strategic Priority Fund](https://www.ukri.org/research/themes-and-programmes/strategic-priorities-fund/) investment to the Alan Turing Institute to support [AI For Science and Government](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg).
The personal highlights are very valuable for capturing the impact that _The Turing Way_ has for its community members in terms of personal networking, professional development, skill sharing and other relevant activities, and how they have made positive impacts around transparency, reproducibility and ethical collaboration in their organisation.

### Recording different types of contributions

In the contribution types discussed below, we use scenarios from some of the most common contribution types.

These examples are also outlined in the next subchapter {ref}`Acknowledgement Examples <ch-acknowledgement-examples>` along with other types of contributions that are made to _The Turing Way_.

**We recommend using these example statements only as a guide.**
As a contributor, you will be able to add as many details as useful for your record.

#### Bug fixes

*A "bug" is a small error in the text or code like typo, formatting issue or broken links.*

Anyone who raises bugs, related issues or fixes them are listed as contributors in the Contributors table with  🐛 (`bug`) emoji.

The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below after the `contributor's detail`:

* Personal highlights:
> I have fixed typos and made other contributions `other details like identified sections of the book that are unclear`.

#### Reviewing chapters and other pull requests

*The review process of a newly contributed chapter or a subsection of an existing chapter involves approving the language and structure of a chapter or a section of a chapter, flagging errors or typos, asking for clarifications if certain parts of the content or statements are unclear, suggesting modifications and improving the overall quality of someone's contribution.*

Anyone who reviews a chapter is listed as reviewers and are acknowledged with 👀 (`review`) emoji in the Contributors table.
