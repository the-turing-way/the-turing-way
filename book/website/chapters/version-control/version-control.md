# Version Control

Version control helps you manage changes to your code and collaborate with others efficiently.  
It allows you to keep a history of edits, track contributions, and revert to previous versions when needed.

## Why Version Control?

Using version control systems such as **Git** ensures that:
- Your project history is preserved.
- You can collaborate safely without overwriting othersâ€™ work.
- You can experiment with new ideas in branches without breaking the main project.

## Example

Always check your repository status before committing changes,  
to make sure your repository is clean and up to date.

```bash
git status
