# Cite _The Turing Way_

All material in _The Turing Way_ is available under a [CC-BY 4.0 licence](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

You can cite _The Turing Way_ through the project's Zenodo archive using DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3332807).

The citation will look something like:

>  The Turing Way Community. (2022). The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research (1.0.2). Zenodo. DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3233853). 

Please visit the [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853) to get the most recent version - the one above is not automatically generated and may be out of date.
DOIs allow us to archive the repository and are useful for tracking the work in academic publications.

You can also share the human-readable URL to a page in the book, for example, {ref}`definitions chapter in the Guide for Reproducible Research<rr-overview-definitions>`, but be aware that the project is under development and these links may change over time.
You might want to include a [web archive link](http://web.archive.org), such as [an archived page for the definitions chapter](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030093753/https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducibility/03/definitions.html), to make sure that you do not end up with broken links everywhere!
