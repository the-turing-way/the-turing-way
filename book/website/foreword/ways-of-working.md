| You might be wondering this | You can learn about that here |
|:----------------------- |:---------------------------------|
| Can I see what people are discussing about without having to participate right now? | You are welcome to read comments on GitHub and visit Slack channels without joining the conversation. |
| Oh! But I have some thoughts and feedback on an ongoing discussion. | Great! Why wait? Join the conversation. We would be delighted to welcome your thoughts. | 
| I read a chapter and want to clarify a minor technical/conceptual thing. Can I simply ask it without opening an issue? | Yes. Please ask away on a suitable Slack channel. |
| I saw a typo or factual error in a chapter, how can I fix it? | (i) You can raise the error by opening a GitHub issue. (ii) You can also directly fix the error by using the 'suggest edit' option on Netlify, that will help in opening a Pull Request. (iii) If you get stuck, ask help in troubleshooting on Slack. |
| I am not very comfortable with GitHub, I don't want to do something wrong on the repository. Help! | We can assure you that you would not 'break' the GitHub repository. Everything there is reversible, thanks to `git` version control system. We encourage you to try out GitHub by fixing some minor errors marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). |
| I want to report a bug. | Use the [bug report issue template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose). |
| I have an idea for a chapter, how should I share it? | You can open an issue using [this issue template for a new chapter](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=CHAPTER_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to describe your idea. |
| Do I have to write the whole chapter when I propose an idea? | You can always invite contributions from others. Do as little as you can, or as much you would like. |
| I saw someone working on a topic that I know a few things about. Can I collaborate in their Pull Request or issue? | Please do comment under the appropriate issue of Pull Request to indicate your interest to collaborate. You can offer your support to review the chapter or co-write the chapter. You can also contribute by creating illustrations of helping add references. |
