(ii) You can also directly fix the error by using the 'suggest edit' option on Netlify, which will help in opening a Pull Request. (iii) If you get stuck, ask for help in troubleshooting on Slack. |
| I am not very comfortable with GitHub, I don't want to do something wrong on the repository. Help! | We can assure you that you will not 'break' the GitHub repository. Everything there is reversible, thanks to `git` version control system. We encourage you to try out GitHub by fixing some minor errors marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). |
