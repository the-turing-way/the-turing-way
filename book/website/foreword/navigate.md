# Navigating _The Turing Way_

_The Turing Way_ handbook is a collection of different guides on data science practices and additional sections to cover different aspects of the project and community approaches.
Each section contains multiple chapters, and each chapters are divided into smaller, self-contained sub-chapters to allow you to navigate the book and its content easily at your own pace.

## _The Turing Way_ Guides 

All community-developed resources on research and data science practices are organised into five guides.
The book started with a guide on research reproducibility, that contains tools, methods and practices from computational aspects of data science.
Other guides contain different socio-technical aspects that should be considered to make data science open, collaborative and ethical, hence, ultimately enhancing the reproducibility of a project.

The decision to integrate different chapters into specific guides is made by community members through open discussions via GitHub issues and Slack.
However, their positions within the book are simply for organisation and access purposes; the guide itself doesn't limit the scope of the chapters and hence can be edited and updated by anyone (including you!) at any time with relevant information.

_The Turing Way_ is not meant to be read from beginning to end!

### Community Handbook

All community processes are captured in {ref}`ch` to provide workflows, guidelines, participatory methods, templates and resources used in various aspects of community management in _The Turing Way_.

### Foreword and Afterword

We have also developed {ref}`fw` and {ref}`aw` to share contexts, backgrounds and supplementary resources from and about _The Turing Way_.

Chapters in the Community Handbook, Foreword and afterword are written by both the project delivery team and community members involved in the different leadership, maintenance or community support roles.

## Areas of Work and Scope

_The Turing Way_ is continually evolving to meet the needs and interests of the community across the following areas of work:

1. Engage diverse stakeholders in _The Turing Way_ through open, inclusive and collaborative efforts, **fostering a community** that collectively shapes research and scientific discourse in data science and AI.
2. Co-create, maintain, and sustain an open-source, **community-driven handbook** on data science, providing tools, practices and real-world examples of **open and reproducible research**.
3. Advocate for **responsible and ethical practices**, promoting transparency, fostering accountability and embedding human rights principles throughout the lifecycle of research, data science and AI projects. 
4. Champion best practices in **communication, collaboration, and project design** as fundamental pillars for making data science and AI accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for all stakeholders.

### Scope of _The Turing Way_

The scope of _The Turing Way_ can be broadly described across six categories, with practices and resources shared openly in the book:

1. **_The Turing Way_ Book:** Disseminating best practices, examples, and recommendations openly in chapters covering reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design, ethics, and community.
2. **_The Turing Way_ Community:** Fostering a diverse and international community, encouraging contributions, building upon existing knowledge, and collaboratively advancing best practices in data science.
3. **Open Leadership:** Promoting open leadership by providing community infrastructure, processes, and resources for individuals from diverse backgrounds and interests to lead and connect a decentralised network of actors and their efforts.
4. **Domain Expertise:** Collaborating with representatives and experts who contextualise and share _The Turing Way_ resources in their respective domains.
5. **Project Partnership:** Proactively partnering with organisations and projects aligned with our vision and mission, combining knowledge, expertise, and resources for the shared benefits of our communities.
6. **Global Impact:** Extending the impact of _The Turing Way_ by conducting global outreach, engaging with different sectors, supporting the localisation of resources, advocating for policy changes and facilitating cross-community efforts

**Get Involved:** If you have ideas and plans for _The Turing Way_, please reach out to _The Turing Way_ team via email at [turingway@turing.ac.uk](mailto:turingway@turing.ac.uk). Your input is valuable to the ongoing development of the project.
