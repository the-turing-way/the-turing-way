# Data Science Without Borders


For effective collaboration among international groups, such as in the Data Science Without Borders project, it is essential to learn, adopt, and implement best practices in open, reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science. These curated chapters will provide starting points, helping you navigate a broader set of practices in The Turing Way.
