# Pathways

The Pathways section of *The Turing Way* presents a community-curated collection of chapters based on different roles and themes in research and data science.

This section has been developed to facilitate multiple entry points that people can select to find information most relevant to them, without having to browse different guides.

You can read more about the background and reason for developing this feature in our {ref}`Community Handbook<ch-pathways>`.

This feature is enabled by a (MyST plugin) developed and maintained by our infrastructure Working Group, details for which are provided in our {ref}`infrastructure chapter<ch-pathways-creating>`.

If there is a persona or user profile that you think is missing, please help us curate that!
Learn more about the {ref}`process of curation<ch-pathways-creating>` and join us in improving this section. ðŸŽ‰
