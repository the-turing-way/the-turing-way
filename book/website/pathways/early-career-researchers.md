# Early Career Researchers


Early Career Researchers (ECRs) are students, PhDs and early-stage postdocs who may not have a lot of experience in contributing to research projects from start to finish. This curated set of chapters will allow them to understand what best practices apply at different stages of development to ensure research reproducibility.
