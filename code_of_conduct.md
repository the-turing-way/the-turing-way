# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Turing Way project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.

Kirstie Whitaker, as PI of this project, and all project members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the Whitaker lab, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Kirstie Whitaker. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Kirstie, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in Whitaker lab projects.

**To report an issue** please contact [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane). All communication will be treated as confidential.

### Flexible working hours

This sentence is stolen from [Bastian Greshake's](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke) email footer and forms the basis of the Whitaker Lab's policy on flexible working:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

The hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails or pull requests over the weekend or late at night, but no lab members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours.

Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. Ideally, all lab members will have at least a few hours each week to overlap with Kirstie in order to stay in touch on any challenges or successes, but it is the policy of the Whitaker Lab that every member is already self-motivated and doesn't need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet their goals.

**If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the lab** please contact [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane). All communication will be treated as confidential.
