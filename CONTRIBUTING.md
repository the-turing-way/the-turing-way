# Contributing to _The Turing Way_

🎉🎈🍰 **Welcome to _The Turing Way_ repository!** 🍰🎈🎉

💫 _We're excited that you're here and want to contribute._ 💫

We want to ensure that every user and contributor feels welcome, included and supported to participate in _The Turing Way_ community.
We hope that the information provided in this document will make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

We welcome all contributions to this project via GitHub issues and pull requests.
Please follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated into the projects.
As you start contributing to _The Turing Way_, don't forget that your ideas are more important than perfect pull requests. ❤️

If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Code of Conduct

_The Turing Way_ is a community-led and collaboratively developed project.
We, therefore, require that all our members and their contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (CoC)**.
Please familiarize yourself with our [CoC](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that lists the expected behaviours.
We have also provided details for CoC reporting and enforcement, which can be read in our [Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coc).

## Inclusivity

_The Turing Way_ aims to be inclusive to people from all walks of life and to all research fields.
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make to the project.

In addition to the CoC, we encourage intentional, inclusive actions from contributors to _The Turing Way_.
For example, you should:

- Use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language.
- Aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds.
- Make sure that the colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors.
  See the blog post [Designing Scientific Figures for Colour Blindness](https://www.lewismackenzie.science/updates-1/2017/2/9/designing-scientific-figures-for-colour-blindness) for an example of how somebody improved one of their diagrams, including links to recommended colour palettes and a colour-blindness simulator.

## Join the Community

There are many ways to engage with the community!
We maintain a set of useful resources and announcements at [the-turing-way.org](https://the-turing-way.org)

### Slack

We use [Slack](https://slack.the-turing-way.org) for more informal and rapid communication.
There are channels for working groups, asking for support, and community discussion.
There are also off-topic channels for socialising with other community members.
Slack is also a good place to receive notifications for upcoming events.

### Newsletter

You can sign up to our [newsletter](https://news.the-turing-way.org) to receive monthly project updates.

### GitHub

_The Turing Way_ is developed on [GitHub](https://git.the-turing-way.org).
We use GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions), [issues](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pulls) to organise ideas and contributions.
[](#working-on-github) explains how to use these features.

### Coworking and Real-Time Collaboration

_The Turing Way_ hosts synchronous events using video conferencing for focused collaboration.
These include working group meetings, regular [collaboration cafes](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-collabcafe/) and week-long [Book Dash](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash/) sprint events.

### Email

You can also contact the Community Management Working Group and the Steering Committee by emailing [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com).

## Making Contributing Through GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub](https://github.com) sits on top of Git and supports collaborative and distributed working.
It can be daunting to start using Git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past.
We are here to help if you encounter problems! ❤️

In order to contribute via GitHub, you'll need to create a free account.
Read the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) for instructions.

## Writing in Markdown

_The Turing Way_ is written almost entirely in Markdown.
In particular, it is written in a flavour of Markdown called [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/).

The [Style Guide](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style/) section of the Community Handbook explains our conventions and recommendations for writing Markdown.
You can also read the [Authoring section of the MyST Markdown Guide](https://mystmd.org/guide) for the complete set of features and syntax.

## Issues and Discussions

Look through open items first; join discussions, collaborate on an ongoing tasks and exchange your thoughts with others.
If you can't find an open item related to your idea, you can open a new one.
Open and discussion if you have a question, or an idea to talk about with the community.
Open an issue if you have a specific task like fixing a bug or editing part of the book.
Our [issue templates](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose) guide you to add the important information.

### Good First Issues

We mark issues suitable for first contributions with the [good first issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) label.

### Good First Pull Requests

If you would like opportunities to review others' contributions, we mark good pull requests for new reviewers with the [good first PR review](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22good+first+PR+review%22) label.

## Making Change With a Pull Request

Changes to the book are always made through pull requests.
We encourage all contributors to work on their own fork of the repository.
Pull requests should be self-contained and as small as possible.

Pull request should be marked as drafts until there are ready for review.

We follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) workflow:

1. Create a feature branch on your fork
2. Commit changes
3. Open a pull request to _The Turing Way_'s repository
  - Open a draft pull request if the work is still in progress
  - Open a pull request if you feel the work is ready for review
4. Iterate on changes in response to CI and reviewer comments
5. Merge when all issues are addressed and changes are approved

### Best Practice

Here are some tips for best practice working with git:

- [keep your fork up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) with the main repository
- Try to keep changes focused.
  If you submit many changes at once it will be much more difficult to review.
- Make small commits often.
- Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit).
- Do not re-write history!
- Open draft pull requests soon, to get early feedback.

### Chapter Templates

If you are writing a new chapter, make use of the [chapter template](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates/chapter-template).

### Local development

You can build the book locally during development.
This is the quickest way to see how you changes affect the book.
The steps are described in [this section](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/local-build) of the The Turing Way.

## Recognising Contributions

We welcome and recognise all kinds of contributions, from fixing small errors, to developing documentation, maintaining the project infrastructure, writing chapters or reviewing existing resources.
The [community handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement/) explains how contributions will be acknowledged and recorded in _The Turing Way_.

To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant issue or pull request with the following:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `<contribution>` types and examples of how we've run this command in [this issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/274).
The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

Please only add one contributor at a time with the bot!
Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one.
Otherwise, the pull requests will tend to have merge conflicts.
Therefore, please check the open pull requests first to make sure there aren't any [open requests from the bot](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pulls/app%2Fallcontributors) before adding another.

Finally, don't forget to add yourself to the [list of contributors](./contributors.md)!
