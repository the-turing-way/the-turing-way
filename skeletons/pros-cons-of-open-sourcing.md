There is related content in the Open Research chapter. We propose leaving `What is open source software` where it is, and we will take the content in `How running and contributing to open source software projects benefits you` and `How open source software benefits research` into this proposed chapter and expand on it.

> Title of the chapter

Why Open Source?

## Sub-Headings

> Sub-Headings (and potentially related topics) that will appear in the chapter

* Sub-heading 1
  * You find a bug and want to fix it
  * Adding a feature that you might want
  * You figure something out that would be helpful to see in the documentation

(We give some examples that we hope people can identify with as to why someone might think about their first contribution)

When you start thinking about contributing to open source, there's a lot of projects out there that you might know which one to pick - but you'll eventually come across something that you naturally want to contribute to. Maybe that's the Turing Way?!

* How does open source improve the quality of software?
  * Solve problems for all users
      * That could be fixing a bug that affects a lot of people
  * Transparency and addressing blackboxes
      * Open sourcing makes it possible to work out what a bug might be
      * For curiosity, can also see what else is going on inside that implementation
      * Increase confidence with using the project
  * Sharing your ideas
      * Can have more of a say in how the project is developed
      * Propose and add features yourself

* Open source communities
  * Working with others
      * You get to meet new people
      * People can find jumping into a strange project intimidating - but there are often structured ways to contribute (such as contributing guidelines, issue templates, Codes of Conduct)
      * You can see what the attitude of the community surrounding the project is like - comments are open
      * Lots of projects make an effort to welcome first time contributors
      * Give examples of these and good-first-issue tag on Github
  * Connecting with others in your field
      * Join an existing project rather than make your own
      * Might feel as though you have less ownership but there are definitely advantages:
      * You can get to meet people in your field and work with them, as opposed to going at it alone and build on existing work
  * Finding time for open source
      * Yes it does take time!
      * It can feel like work but it can also be fun, and sometimes work will give you time
      * The community can support you in learning about the package or working how much time a particular task/feature might take or whether you're expected to maintain your contribution
      
* Open source in academia and industry
  * Does open sourcing == scooping? No
      * Keeping code private is totally okay but its still good to think about the open sourcing of it early
      * Alternatively, you could have an open package and keep the analysis private for a while
      * Give some examples of open source academic code
  * Working with industry
      * Some companies prefer to work with open source code because they can see it
      * Permissive licensing means that companies can use open code
  * Commercialisation
      * It is possible to earn money from open source projects
      * Give examples
  * Credit for open source
      * Open packages that you work on can become recognised, especially within domain-specific communities
      * You are credited for your work and your reputation benefits from it
      * It raises the profile of your place of work and may attract more candidates for hiring
      * Might come in useful when searching for jobs

* Social good
  * Open source software is useful
      * Other people might want to use it
      * You can help out a project that already has a lot of users
      * Its good to have a project where you can talk directly to the developers
  * Helping out a project
      * Can help to maintain and improve projects that may not have the resources to do so otherwise
      * Making sure a useful project doesn't get abandoned

* The good stuff
  * It's fun!
      * Doing something good in the community
      * Add quotes from people
  * Hacktoberfest!
  * You learn lots of new stuff
      * Learn how to contribute and get feedback on how you're doing
      * You might worry about "whether the code is good enough" but you'll be in a space where you can get plenty of feedback and develop your confidence
      * Develop technical skills
      * Learn about the package/project in detail
      * Community skills - managing collaborations, planning events and community management

* End of chapter checklist
    * Things to be aware of before making your first contribution
    * [ ] Check that the project is truly open source - it should be possible to ask questions and make suggestions as well as see the code
    * [ ] Look for community guidelines - this could be contributing guidelines, issue templates, Code of Conduct that will make you more familiar how the project manages contributions
    * [ ] Check for active development - response times to issues and pull requests, and recent commit dates
