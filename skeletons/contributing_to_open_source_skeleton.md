# Contributing to Open Source

## What is A Useful Contribution

* The first place to look is the projects issue tracker. The open issues may
  give an indication of what needs to be done immediately and the longer term
  directions of the project. If you have an idea that is not addressed in the
  issues, then you should open an issue to propose the idea or start a
  discussion.

* there's no contribution too small, contributions don't have to be code
    * In fact, code is probably the last thing to contribute when you have just
      joined a project
    * correcting typos or broken links in docs
    * making docs clearer
    * this helps new users (which may become new maintainers!)
    * documentation is hard

* tutorials/documentation
    * creating or maintaining
    * how are you supposed to use this project anyway?
    * Not just "how to develop" docs
    * Get the user using as quickly as possible
    * dev docs can be done automatically (sometimes) whereas user docs are more difficult as they often need an example

* speaking language translations
    * broadens the audience

* software bugfixes (put this last, to reflect our opinion that code
  contributions come last)

## What is Not a Useful Contribution

* What's NOT a useful contribution?
    * going off and developing some complicated feature request without asking/opening an issue first
    * Not being aware of the desired features and working on something low priority (not unwelcome, but maybe not the best use of time)
    * Coming along and completely changing the project
* being aware of the roadmap
    * list of desired features and their priority
    * are they opinionated about what kind of features they want to support?
