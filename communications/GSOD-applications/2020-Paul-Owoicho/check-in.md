# Paul's biweekly meeting notes.

### Date: 19 October 2020

This is the first check-in, so it refers to my activities since Sep. 28th.

#### Who did you help this week?

- While I didn't help a particular person, I have been helping to facilitate Hactoberfest by reviewing PRs, and supporting new contributors where I can.

#### Who helped you this week?

- Malvika has been super supportive with helping me getting settled into the community. She has also given me helpful pointers with working with Github, and giving me an overall sense of direction as I contribute to The Turing Way.
- Neha (my OLS project partner) and Sam (my OLS project mentor) have been very helpful in terms of sharing ideas, giving feedback, and completing OLS assignments. 

#### What did you achieve?

- I began working on editing chapters based on the consistency checklist in issue #1174. So far, I have gone through the book up until the chapter on Reproducible Environments. A few PRs have been made with my suggested changes, but I need to revisit those PRs to make them easier to review.

#### What did you struggle with?

- I am learning to work with git/github for collaboration as I go along (side effect of this is that some of my PRs are hard to review)
- Getting feedback from the larger community for the work I am doing
- Editing the entire book in a month (according to my initial plans) is not going as fast as I hoped

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Cleaning up my current PRs
- Creating a consistency chapter to empower new contributors make The Turing Way consistent
- There are some missing content in the book. I want to make a start on addressing this by completing a subchapter on Data Licences. My content will be based on work from another contributor 

#### Where do you need help from Malvika and Kirstie?

- Feedback on PRs and overall direction so that I can know that my work is on the right track. This is already in place. 

### Date: 26 October 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

- Continued supporting new contributors and reviewing PRs

#### Who helped you this week?

- Malvika, Neha both gave helpful ideas for how to empower others to contribute to the project
- @martintoreilly opened an issue for something I worked on in one of my PRs, so I got him to review the PR and give me feedback

#### What did you achieve?

- Wrote a chapter on Achieving Consistency based on the consistency checklist I curated. Malvika will review this shortly
- Modularised old PRs so they are easy to review

#### What did you struggle with?

- One item on the consistency checklist is to convert HTML to markdown so that content renders properly on Netlify, this might not always be worthwhile

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- This week, I will be creating issues for chapters that do pass the consistency checklist
- Next week, I will begin working on developing templates for new chapters/case studies etc

#### Where do you need help from Malvika and Kirstie?

- reviews and feedback


### Date: 23 November 2020

This check-in documents my activities since Oct. 26th.

#### Who did you help this week?

My work has been focused on making the Turing Way accessible to new contributors..

- Supported some new contributors during the book dash week in generating ideas and creating their first PRs
- Revised the consistency chapter to help guide contributors in making The Turing Way consistent
- Created many good first issues for new contributors to get started contributing to the project

#### Who helped you this week?

- Malvika for reviewing my PRs, plus providing overall direction for my work
- Neha for reviewing my PRs and providing lots of helpful feedback
- Kirstie for providing overall direction

#### What did you achieve?

- Participated in the book dash!
- Made lot of good first issues, more are coming
- Merged the consistency chapter
- created templates for: new chapters, case studies, issues
- Raised an issue on the Jupyter Book repo for the ability to generate PDFs. There's a temporary workaround for now but it means PDFs wont be up to date

#### What did you struggle with?

- I would like to improve the consistency chapter with how-to videos - audio capture on my laptop is not great. 
  - Maybe it can be how-to tutorials instead

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Think and implement a way to create explainer videos for items in the consistency checklist (perhaps without voice)
- Make good first issues for the rest of the book

#### Where do you need help from Malvika and Kirstie?

- reviews and feedback
