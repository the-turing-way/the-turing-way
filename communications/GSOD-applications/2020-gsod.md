### Title

* The Turing Way, a how to guide to data science


### Short Description

The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led and collaboratively developed book project on making data research accessible for a wider research community ([https://the-turing-way.netlify.com](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com)).
We bring together individuals from diverse fields and expertise to develop practices and learning resources that can make data research comprehensible and useful for everyone.
The project is openly developed and all questions, comments, recommendations and discussion are facilitated through an [online GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

Our community members are researchers, engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and experts in various domains, at all levels of seniority, from all around the world.
Since the project's launch in April 2019, they have co-authored chapters on [research reproducibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducibility/reproducibility.html) by compiling best practices, tools and recommendations used by the scientific communities worldwide. This year we extend the scope of The Turing Way book to include different aspects such as project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research ([preview](https://deploy-preview-977--the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), pull request [#977](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/977)).

For this project, the Google Season of Docs technical writer will review the [existing chapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/content) and provide editorial support on incorporating new content, such as the chapters on [distributed collaboration](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acollaboration-book), which are currently under development.
Based on their personal preference, they will have the possibility to contribute to one or more newly proposed sections of the book by developing resources (in English) such as new chapters, interactive tutorials, impact stories, and case studies with the help of our community members.
If they have a good understanding of Chinese, Hindi or Spanish, they can also choose to translate the existing materials in one of these languages.

More details are provided in the attached proposal.

### Long Description

***To be uploaded as PDF to the application form***

The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led and collaboratively developed book project on making data research accessible for a wider research community ([https://the-turing-way.netlify.com](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com)). 
We bring together individuals from diverse fields and expertise to develop practices and learning resources that can make data research comprehensible and useful for everyone.
The project is openly developed and all questions, comments, recommendations and discussion are facilitated through an [online GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

Our community members are researchers, engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and experts in various domains, at all levels of seniority, from all around the world. 
Since the project's launch in April 2019, they have co-authored chapters on [research reproducibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducibility/reproducibility.html) by compiling best practices, tools and recommendations used by the scientific communities worldwide.  

Since the project has grown from a small team of 10 researchers to a community of 125 contributors, the scope of The Turing Way book has also expanded to include different aspects such as project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research ([preview](https://deploy-preview-977--the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), pull request [#977](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/977)).
The project aims to provide learning and training resources on a wide array of topics and builds on case studies provided by Turing researchers, impact stories contributed by individuals, and workshops delivered by the team members. 

For this project, the Google Season of Docs technical writer will review the [existing chapters](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/content) and provide editorial support on incorporating new content, such as the chapters on [distributed collaboration](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acollaboration-book), which are currently under development. 
Based on their personal preference, they will have the possibility to contribute to one or more newly proposed sections of the book by developing resources (in English) such as new chapters, interactive tutorials, impact stories, and case studies with the help of our community members. 
If they have a good understanding of Chinese, Hindi or Spanish, they can also choose to translate the existing materials in one of these languages. 
They will be provided with appropriate guidance and opportunity to work in a positive working environment. 
They will be fairly acknowledged for their contributions to the project. 
The final goal will be to identify opportunities to enhance the quality of the book by improving its language and structure that can make The Turing Way accessible for graduate students, research software engineers, senior investigators and administrative teams.

#### Optional technical reading:

The Turing Way is hosted as a [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/) at https://the-turing-way.netlify.com. Jupyter Books can format markdown files and Jupyter notebooks as static HTML making them easy to read. 
When a notebook is included in the book, the static page includes a link to an interactive version of the notebook via [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io). 
We are upgrading to the latest version of Jupyter book and intend to integrate more interactive features, which are currently underutilised. 
The translation efforts are supported through [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/theturingway/theturingway/dashboard/).

#### Required skills

- Writing and editing skills in the English language
- Experience working in distributed communities, ideally using git and GitHub
- Experience collaborating on data science or quantitiative research projects at any level

#### Optional skills

- Interactive visualisation
- Data science ethics
- Community building
- Translating English content into Chinese, Hindi or Spanish

### Possible mentors

- Malvika Sharan (msharan@turing.ac.uk)
- Kirstie Whitaker (kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk)

### Expected outcome

An enhanced version of The Turing Way’s existing chapters, editorial support for new contributions by the community members and resource development for one of the newly proposed sections of the book.

### Difficulty level

Medium if the candidate has prior experience of working with git and GitHub. 
However, resources and guidance will be provided by the mentors.

### Previous experience as a mentor

#### What previous experience have you had creating documentation or collaborating with technical writers?

I am a community manager of The Turing Way, a community-led open-source project on data science. It is a collaboratively developed book project, which requires constant communication with the contributors in the form of community documentation, newsletters or online meetings. All contributions are written documents such as learning resources on technical skills, which are facilitated via our GitHub repository (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). Many contributors require mentored contributions and all contributions are reviewed before they are integrated into the main project. As a community facilitator, I support our contributors by pointing them to the right resources, reviewing their contributions, inviting others to review specialised contributions and ensuring an overall engagement of the community members. In this process, I also create many technical and community-related documents.

I am also an active contributor to The Carpentries training and governance documents. As a co-lead of the Open Life Science mentoring program, I also develop training and learning resources for our mentoring community.

#### What previous experience have you had mentoring individuals?

I have mentored in Mozilla Open Leaders and the Carpentries mentoring programs. 

Currently I co-lead a mentoring program on open science for young researchers in life science call open Life Science where we are leading 29 mentees with their 20 group projects.

#### What previous experience have you had creating documentation or collaborating with technical writers?

*Note that Kirstie is mentoring two possible projects, The Turing Way and BIDS Apps*

The Turing Way is a community lead project that started with a core of paid contributors as part of the UK's strategic priority fund investment in AI and Data Science for Engineering, Health, Science and Government (https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/alan-turing-institute-spearhead-new-cutting-edge-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).
We have now transitioned to one paid community manager who mentors more than 150+ contributors from around the world.
The Turing Way is an interactive handbook for reproducible, collaborative and transparent data science.
It is published as a jupyter book at https://the-turing-way.netlify.com.
We build the project openly via GitHub (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) and put a high focus on welcoming contributions from a broad range of backgrounds.
All the work is technical documentation.
As a writing prompt we ask active data scientists "What do you wish you had read, or that your collaborators had read, when you started your most recent project?"

The BIDS Starter Kit was a Google Summer of Code project in 2018.
I mentored Patrick Park as he worked to make the Brain Imaging Data Structure a little more accessible (https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5052346392379392).
Although we originally proposed the project as developing interactive tutorials, we realised that what the community really needed was additional - and accessible - documentation.
This has developed into a detailed README file (https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md), a clear set of contributing guidelines (https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and extensive wiki support (https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki).
For contributions to the main repository we (Patrick, myself and the four co-mentors from that summer project) reviewed each other's work in pull requests, for contributions to the wiki we used GitHub issues to track where changes had happened and give feedback.

BIDS and Turing Way community members put a high emphasis on clear communication, documentation and interdisciplinary engagement to help build a healthy community.
In both cases it is clear where the expertise of a technical writer would benefit the project.
From asking the right questions, knowing their audience and having the skills to capture implicit knowledge, I am confident that the BIDS project (not just the starter kit) and The Turing Way will be greatly enhanced from their expertise. 

#### What previous experience have you had mentoring individuals?

I have mentored three GSOC students in 2018 and 2019 (Patrick Park, https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5052346392379392, Monica Yao, https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6245424317333504 and Ruslan Yermakov https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5905590751068160).
I am the founder and lead developer of The Turing Way and have mentored contributions to that project from around the world and from a broad range of academic backgrounds.
I am a member of the inaugural BIDS Steering Group, specifically because of my focus on clear communications within distributed open source communities.
I have extensive experience mentoring PhD and MSc students in person and in distributed networks across multiple timezones.
I have core collaborators in Canada, the USA, and across five institutions in the UK.
I am confident working and mentoring using GitHub for project management, Slack and Gitter for distributed conversations, and my weekly lab meetings have members "Zoom" in from around the world.

As a Mozilla Fellow in 2016/17 I contributed to a global network of open leaders focusing on diversity and inclusion as necessary pathways to harnessing the power of open source to build a better world for all.
The Turing Way and BIDS communities are spread around the world.
I hope the distributed nature of these networks are a benefit to the GSOD technical writer.
They will not be the only person connecting remotely. Rather, they will be joining a large and distributed group of people passionate about contributing to open science tools, practices and systems.
