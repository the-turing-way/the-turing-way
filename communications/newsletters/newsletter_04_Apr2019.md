# The Turing Way - Book launched

Dear friends of the Turing Way,

we're so happy to announce that we have successfully [launched our handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com) at the Collaborations Workshop.
To create the standalone book, we moved the book content into a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way-book/) and tidied the main repository as announced in our last newsletter.
We will still keep discussions going in issues on [our main repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). 
If you find this confusing and are not sure where your contribution should go, just ping us in [our gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

Special thanks to Richard Gilham, Dan Hobley, Robin Long, and Sarah Stewart who joined Kirstie and our new team member Rachael Ainsworth in improving The Turing Way on the hackday.
In addition to the core chapters the team wrote over the last months, they contributed:
* a new chapter on software risk assessment
* a new chapter on code review
* several improvements to layout and style
and helped us improving our contribution guidelines.

## Join us for a book dash 

Building on their fabulous contributions, we would like to use the next months to further improve the book and thus invite you to join us for one of our book dashes.
A book dash is a one day collaborative event where you'll work with others to add to and improve the Turing Way book.

We're going to host you for dinner the night before, and give you the opportunity to promote any projects that you're working in that evening, and then hopefully we'll have an intense 9 to 5 day working on the book.

There are SO many people who have expertise that the Turing Way can benefit from. 
The skills we're looking for include, but are not limited to:

- sci comm skills: skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications
- great examples and case studies of reproducible research
- writing new chapters (either from the [wish list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/book_skeleton.md) or beyond)
- editing the current chapters
- updating how the book looks online (css, logos, layout etc)

Successful applicants will receive travel and accommodation to attend one of our book dashes as laid out in the agenda below:

Day 1
