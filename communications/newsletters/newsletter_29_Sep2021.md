## Community Events

### Join the First Fireside Chat on 22 October

On 22 October, 14:00 - 15:00 London time ([see in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-10-22/14:00)), we will kick-off The Turing Way Fireside Chat series. 
At this very first call, The Turing Way lead Kirstie Whitaker and researcher Malvika Sharan will be joined by a core member from our community to discuss research reproducibility, accessible resources in data science and the role of The Turing Way in this landscape.
We are particularly excited to bring existing and new members together who can ask questions such as "what exactly is The Turing Way?", "how did it start?", "what challenges are we trying to address in data science and research?" and "what can we expect next?". 
Please [register via the Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-fireside-chat-tickets-185011543507).

**_The Turing Way_ Fireside Chat Series**

We are launching **_The Turing Way_ Fireside Chat Series** to facilitate cross-community engagement, knowledge exchange and open discussions with the participants.

## Acknowledgements and Celebrations

### Contributor in Focus: Katerina Drakoulaki

Today’s contributor, Katerina Drakoulaki, did something truly unique - she created a GitHub issue not to raise errors or suggest new topics, but to share appreciation.
Under [issue #2100](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2100), she shares her experience as a researcher, learner and *The Turing Way* user.
Her post demonstrates that our contributors are not only those who write new chapters but also those who use them to advance their research and teach data science skills to others.

**About Katerina**: SHe is a PhD student at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, where she investigates the relationship between linguistic, cognitive and music skills of Greek-speaking preschoolers. 
She is a speech and language therapist and I have clinical experience working with paediatric populations.
She is also the [Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research Fellow](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/).
As part of her fellowship, she read and used several chapters from *The Turing Way* in her work.

In her post, she writes:
> As the Frictionless Data Fellow for reproducible research helped me understand, and by extension, the Turing Way project, that many of the issues I was facing were not because of my lack of abilities and knowledge. 
> They were shortcomings of the way postgraduate education (and research) works: you are expected to magically know how to handle your data, clean it, save it safely, analyse it and communicate your results. 
> Especially when your background is not data-focused these things can feel intimidating, both in terms of your understanding but also in terms of your mentality toward tackling data issues.
> So, of course when I came across the resources I tried to follow what was possible, and made my life easier in the process!

![Katerina tweeted "I wrote something for The Turing Way - ways in which I use and plan on using their resources - they're great!"](images/2021-10-katerinaweet.png)

### Talks and Workshops

- This month, Martina G. Vilas gave a talk - **_The Turing Way_ and approaches to reproducible and generalizable research**.
Building on her previous talks, she added more context on how to investigate the generalisability of research claims.
Find her slides [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5497717).
- Kirstie Whitaker and Malvika Sharan delivered a workshop to the new graduate students at The Alan Turing Institute on 08 September.
Under the theme, **Effective Collaboration in a Distributed (Research) World**, they discussed what challenges early career researchers to face and how they can prepare in advance for collaboration.
Find the workshop materials [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5484384).
- On 21 September, Malvika gave a keynote at Open Science Fair 2021 under the title **Can we reimagine FAIR for building communities in Open Science**.

## HiddenRef Awardees Announced

The hidden REF is a competition that recognises all research outputs and every role that makes research possible. 
The Award Ceremony was moderated by Patricia Herterich on 2 September 2021 and the winners were announced by the committee for the five categories: Communicative Outputs, Applications of Research, Practices, Contexts and Hidden Role.
Thanks to Emma Karoune, our core contributor and member of the Book Dash Planning Committee, for leading *The Turing Way* submission and representing the project at the award ceremony.
We are very delighted to hear that _The Turing Way_ was commended under the ‘practices’ category.

![Emma tweeted "Super happy to see the hard work of the Turing Way community recognised in the HiddenRe ceremony.](images/2021-10-emmaweet.png)

## ELIXIR-UK FAIR Data Stewardship Training Fellow

We congratulate Emma Karoune for being named the ELIXIR-UK FAIR data stewardship training Fellow 2021.
ELIXIR-UK has partnered with the Software Sustainability Institute to build this Fellowship Programme to support and fund Data Stewards to train researchers in how to manage and share data in the life sciences.
Emma is particularly interested in how researchers can work with sensitive data to make it FAIR and also how we can build inclusive research communities to bring about more sustainable data sharing.
