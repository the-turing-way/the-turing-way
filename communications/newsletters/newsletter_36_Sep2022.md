The Turing Way Newsletter: 1 September 2022

# End of summer updates from The Turing Way community

Hi everyone,

Happy end-of-August!‚òÄÔ∏èüòé 

This newsletter is coming a bit later to you all, after a mid-summer break for the month of July and August (which have been hot ones here in the UK). As always, this newsletter is absolutely full of a ton of updates from our community ‚Äì¬†so much in fact, that we're splitting it in two! 

This update is focused on Community News updates, while our usual mid-month update will focus on updates to *The Turing Way* book. Stay tuned!

* üèÉ **Check out Talks and Workshops** to learn more about talks that community leaders have given in the past few months. 
* üî• Catch up on our July and August Fireside chats on **'Navigating growth and scale to sustain open communities'** and **'Defining Open Infrastructure in  Different Contexts'"** on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTuringWay)
* ‚òï The next **Collaboration Cafe** is happening on 7 September , 15:00 - 17:00 UTC+1. [See details](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe).

As always, you can find more updates and opportunities in the 'Community News' and 'Opportunities in the Turing Way orbit' sections below.

If you're interested in keeping up with the community in real time, don't forget that you can always join our [Slack workspace](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack) or follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turingway).

## Rewatch the August Fireside Chat

![Alt:Flier for Fireside Chat event for August. Defining 'open' infrastructure in different contexts](https://i.imgur.com/AFYuzDa.png)

On 26 August 2022, we hosted a fireside chat on ‚ÄúDefining ‚Äòopen infrastructure‚Äô in different contexts‚Äù.

This fireside chat brought together different perspectives on ‚Äòopen infrastructure‚Äô within and around research environments in order to ask the questions: what is open infrastructure anyway, for researchers and otherwise? How do these narratives and definitions of open infrastructure affect what kind of work is valued within them? 

Chaired by Rayya El Zein (Code for Science & Society) and Anne Lee Steele (The Turing Way), this panel featured insights from Richard Dunks (Invest in Open Infrastructure), Lillian Achom (Access Plus) and Sarah Gibson (2i2c). [Watch the recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2NXe74nSc&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl&index=8).

## Rewatch the July Fireside Chat

![Alt:Flier for Fireside Chat event for July. Navigating growth and scale to sustain open communities](https://i.imgur.com/N9KCQsI.jpg)

Last month on 29 July 2022, we hosted a next fireside chat will take place on the topic: **Navigating growth and scale to sustain open communities**.

This Fireside chat brought together projects and communities across the open ecosystem to talk more about the shared questions, challenges, and trade-offs that come with ‚Äòscaling‚Äô communities ‚Äì and steps they have taken within their own communities to address them. 

Chaired by Alycia Crall (The Carpentries) and Anne Lee Steele (The Turing Way), this panel featured insights from Geoffrey Kateregga (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team), Patrick Mineault (xcorr neuroAI consulting) and Selene Yang (Wikimedia Foundation, Geochicas - OpenStreetMap). [Watch the recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0t_K5FNalU&t=17s).

## Community-led UNESCO response

*In response to the adoption of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science in November 2021, UNESCO launched a Global Call for Best Practices in Open Science in November 2021*. This year, *The Turing Way* (TTW), Open Life Science (OLS), and Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) communities organised three calls to develop community-led responses to the UNESCO call.

*The Turing Way* response, titled ‚ÄòBroadening the definition and implementation of accessibility, inclusion and incentivisation in open science' was [published on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6841867).

Thanks goes to Esther Plomp, Emmy Tsang, Arielle Bennett, Patricia Heterich, Alina Popescu, Eirini Zormpa, Emma Karoune, Vicky Hellon, Alejandro Coca-Castro, Batool Almarzouq, Anne Lee Steele, and Malvika Sharan who developed *The Turing Way* response. Thank you for thoughtful considerations on open science, and for joining us in this opportunity to combine our perspectives.
