## We invite your review and response

### What impact The Turing Way has on your work?

As a community-driven project, we are not always aware of who our users are (if not already engaged in the community), who benefits from the project and what impact we have had in the data science community and research culture so far. 
To capture these, we invite you to comment under issue [#1659](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1659). You can also directly reply to [Kirstie’s tweet](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1326126705270984710?s=20).

## Contributors in focus: Book Dash November 2020 Attendees

From 9 to 13 November 2020, we hosted the fourth Book Dash event of The Turing Way, which took place entirely online across multiple time zones. 
From a pool of excellent applicants, 20 participants were selected to join us during development and social sessions throughout the week. 
We were delighted to get to know them, as they collaborated with each other to contribute to diverse aspects of The Turing Way.

## News from the community

### Guides and templates to assist new contributors

Our [GSoD](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1075) intern, Paul Owoicho has been working tirelessly to improve the project’s accessibility for our users and contributors. 
With the support of his Open Life Science (OLS-2) team member, Neha Moopen, he has published a chapter in our community handbook on [Maintaining Consistency](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/consistency.html). 
This chapter is a valuable resource to bring cohesiveness and a standard structure across the entire book through retrospective editing of existing chapters and development of new chapters through future contributions.
Additionally, he has co-developed a set of templates for writing new chapters, creating case studies, and adding personal stories. 
Check them out in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates).

### Web Annotation by hypothes.is

_Screenshot of our [welcome page](https://book.the-turing-way.org/welcome.html) showing an annotation added through hypothes.is._
Using [Commenting and annotating](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/comments.html) feature of the Jupyter Book, Martina G. Vilas and Batool Almarzouq have integrated [web.hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) in The Turing Way book. 
This will enable our readers to comment on and highlight different parts of the book to share their thoughts, raise errors or create notes.

### New subchapters on Remote Collaboration and Research Data Management Toolkits

After several months of wrangling contributions and compiling resources, we have finally merged our chapter on [Remote Collaboration](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/remote-collab.html). 
This chapter consists of 10 subchapters, which largely aims to provide an action-oriented resource to users who are organising, hosting, chairing and attending virtual events such as team meetings, conferences, sprints, coworking and informal coffee-chats.

A research data management (RDM) toolkit provides information and advice about the data management activities in the whole data lifecycle. 
Thanks to Kim De Ruyck and Albert Hornos, we have a new subchapter on [RDM Toolkit](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-toolkits.html). 
Read and share these resources, and help us enhance them by adding examples from your work.
