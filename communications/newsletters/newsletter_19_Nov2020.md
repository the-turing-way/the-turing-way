## We invite your review and response

### What impact The Turing Way has on your work?

As a community-driven project, we are not always aware of who our users are (if not already engaged in the community), who benefits from the project and what impact we have had in the data science community and research culture so far. 
To capture these, we invite you to comment under issue [#1659](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1659). You can also directly reply to [Kirstie‚Äôs tweet](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1326126705270984710?s=20).

### Review README.md‚Äôs translated files

Thanks to the Hacktoberfest contributors, our README.md file has been [translated into several languages](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/README-translated). 
We invite reviews on the latest Pull Requests (PR) by members who are proficient in Korean ([PR #1650](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1650)), Arabic ([PR #1586](https://app.tinyletter.com/(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1586)), Polish ([PR #1470](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1470)) or Indonesian ([PR #1354](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1354)). 
You are also welcome to translate this file into a language that is currently missing, which can help your community members to learn about The Turing Way._

### Review PRs on new chapters

The following drafts for the new chapters are open for reviews from anyone who may find these topics interesting and would like to help in improving them:
*  The easy way to work with Github: [PR #1559](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1559)

### Review minor updates in the existing chapters

Based on this [checklist for maintaining consistency](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/consistency.html#consistency-checklist), Paul Owoicho has opened a few PR‚Äôs fixing consistency issues in some existing chapters. 
Help us test this consistency checklist by reviewing [these PRs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+PR+review%22).
We also have [Good first issues for new contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that you can address by opening new PRs.

## Contributors in focus: Book Dash November 2020 Attendees

From 9 to 13 November 2020, we hosted the fourth Book Dash event of The Turing Way, which took place entirely online across multiple time zones. 
From a pool of excellent applicants, 20 participants were selected to join us during development and social sessions throughout the week. 
We were delighted to get to know them, as they collaborated with each other to contribute to diverse aspects of The Turing Way.

_Zoom screenshot of our community share-out event on 13 November 2020 at the Book Dash._
Here are some highlights from the event:
* The ethics team members, **Ismael Kherroubi Garcia, Laura Carter and Sophia Batchelor (UK)** were joined by **Irene Komal P. (India) and Asha Susan Titus (UK)** who managed to work on multiple chapters that will be hosted in the Guide for Ethical Research.
* **Laura Aci√≥n (Argentina) and Lupe Canaviri Maydana (Bolivia)** mainly worked on the chapter on Leadership in data science.
* **Batool Almarzouq (Saudi Arabia) and Brigitta Sip≈ëcz (USA)** together designed a chapter of GitHub actions. Batool also managed to translate the README file in Arabic.
* **Samuel Guay (Canada)** started to work on different aspects of French translation and Marilina Santero (Spain) translated our promotional materials in Spanish.
*  **Veronika Cheplygina (The Netherlands)** started a chapter on project workflow that will be hosted in the Guide for Project Design.
*  **Carlos Martinez-Ortiz (The Netherlands)** managed community contributions from his team members from Netherlands eScience Centre.
*  **Paul Owoicho, Neha Moopen and Emma Karoune (UK)** worked on book‚Äôs accessibility aspects such as a chapter on maintaining consistency, a chapter on GitHub for beginners, creating glossary and template to facilitate future contributions.
*  **Marta Mangiarulo (UK)** worked on a chapter on data visualisation and pre-registration.
*  **Sangram Keshari Sahu (India)** worked on creating a case study for reproducibility in bioinformatics.
Two core contributors **Martina G. Vilas and Sarah Gibson** also participated in the Book Dash to facilitate mentored contributions, especially by supporting participants who were new to the projects. 
Additionally, several participants from Biohackathon-EU 2020, which was running in parallel to the Book Dash, also joined us in multiple development and informal sessions. 
Special thanks to **Kim De Ruyck, Albert Hornos, Jose Maria Fernandez, Philippe Rocca-Serra and Wolmar Nyberg √Ökerstr√∂m**. 
Read more about them in [issue #1584](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1584). 
The full report will be shared in the next newsletter.

## News from the community

### Guides and templates to assist new contributors

Our [GSoD](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1075) intern, Paul Owoicho has been working tirelessly to improve the project‚Äôs accessibility for our users and contributors. 
With the support of his Open Life Science (OLS-2) team member, Neha Moopen, he has published a chapter in our community handbook on [Maintaining Consistency](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/consistency.html). 
This chapter is a valuable resource to bring cohesiveness and a standard structure across the entire book through retrospective editing of existing chapters and development of new chapters through future contributions.
Additionally, he has co-developed a set of templates for writing new chapters, creating case studies, and adding personal stories. 
Check them out in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates).

### Web Annotation by hypothes.is

_Screenshot of our [welcome page](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) showing an annotation added through hypothes.is._
Using [Commenting and annotating](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/comments.html) feature of the Jupyter Book, Martina G. Vilas and Batool Almarzouq have integrated [web.hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) in The Turing Way book. 
This will enable our readers to comment on and highlight different parts of the book to share their thoughts, raise errors or create notes.

### New subchapters on Remote Collaboration and Research Data Management Toolkits

After several months of wrangling contributions and compiling resources, we have finally merged our chapter on [Remote Collaboration](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/remote-collab.html). 
This chapter consists of 10 subchapters, which largely aims to provide an action-oriented resource to users who are organising, hosting, chairing and attending virtual events such as team meetings, conferences, sprints, coworking and informal coffee-chats.

A research data management (RDM) toolkit provides information and advice about the data management activities in the whole data lifecycle. 
Thanks to Kim De Ruyck and Albert Hornos, we have a new subchapter on [RDM Toolkit](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-toolkits.html). 
Read and share these resources, and help us enhance them by adding examples from your work.
