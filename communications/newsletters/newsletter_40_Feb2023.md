## Book Dash 2023: calls for applications

![Alt: A hand drawn scriberia image in pink and greyscale populate the right side of the digital flier. There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The title says "Book Dash Applications are open! 22-26 May 2023, London, UK (and worldwide!)". Subtitle says: "Apply to: participate in a week-long event with The Turing Way community, meet other community members from around the world, join an ongoing project or team, Host a local hub within your university, city or region."

# In *The Turing Way* Orbit

## Superbloom: Survey for Usable Software Ecosystem Research 

Funded by the Sloan Foundation, our friends at Superbloom (formerly Simply Secure) are researching how scientific open source software teams understand, consider, and undertake usability and design initiatives in their projects. 
They are seeking responses to a brief survey, in order to get a broad range of insights and opinions from the open source scientific software ecosystem. 
The project is titled ‚ÄúUsable Software Ecosystem Research‚Äù or ‚ÄúUSER‚Äù for short. They are investigating:
- How norms in academic, science, and/or open source working environments affect the choices teams make around their users and different kinds of design interventions
- How team dynamics and trust affects those choices
- What teams would need to be interested in or able to prioritize usability in their work.

[Access the survey here](https://tools.simplysecure.org/survey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=19193&newtest=Y&lang=en).
