## Community meetings

### Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration on 21 May: Sign up!

On 21 May 2021, *The Turing Way* team is hosting two Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration sessions at [11:00 London time (UTC+1)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-05-21/11:00) and [14:00 London time (UTC+1)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-05-21/14:00). 
Everyone interested in the project is invited - please sign up to attend one or both sessions via [this Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-community-share-out-and-contributor-celebration-tickets-152668512631?ref=estw).

At these online calls, members of our community like the participants attending the Book Dash event from 17-20 May, will showcase their contributions to the book, share what they are working on and invite collaborations. 
This event will be ideal for anyone interested to learn about *The Turing Way*, see what recent updates have made in the project and celebrate the incredible work of our contributors. 
In the registration form, you can indicate if you would like to showcase your contributions to the project.

### GitHub Session for Beginners on 13 May 2021: Sign up!

We will be hosting a 1-hour GitHub session for beginners or new users of GitHub for collaborative projects like *The Turing Way* on 13 May 2021 from [16:00 - 17:00 London time (UTC+1)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2021-05-12/16:00).
You can [sign up on this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/-3_C0USqRLe-ReQEdBaX3Q?both#Sign-up-below-by-adding-your-name) (you can directly add your name on the left panel).

This event is being organised in preparation for the upcoming Book Dash to ensure that our contributors feel confident about using GitHub.
Particularly, we want to:
* enhance the understanding of Open Source projects, 
* highlight the importance of version control for reproducibility, and
* promote collaborative practices as we build *The Turing Way* together.

## News from the community

### Meet the  Book Dash Planning Committee 

We are excited to share that **Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Brigitta Sipocz, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp and Laura Carter** have joined the Book Dash Planning Committee as the core contributors and returning members of *The Turing Way*.
**Carlos Martinez and Pablo Rodriguez-Sanchez** will also represent the interest and vision of the Netherlands eScience Center in the committee and run an event in parallel to the Book Dash (17-21 May 2021) to engage their team members in contributing to *The Turing Way*.

These members bring multiple perspectives and interests that are essential for building an equitable and supportive environment for our Book Dash attendees.
They have already reviewed the Book Dash applications and are helping finalise logistics ensuring fairness and accessibility before, during and after the event.
You can read about the Book Dash online in [*The Turing Way* book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html).

## Relevant Resources and Announcements

### Open Geospatial Data Science of *The Turing Way* - Brown Bag Seminar

*Announcement of the Brown Bag Seminar by the Geographic Data Science Lab Organizer*

On 6 May 2021, the Geographic Data Science Lab  Organizer will host a Brown Bag seminar under the title: Open Geospatial Data Science of *The Turing Way*. 
The event will start with an introduction to *The Turing Way* and Responsible Data Science Special Interest group by Ana Basiri, a Professor in Geospatial Data Science and a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellow at the University of Glasgow.
Together with Hyesop Shin and Terry Lines (researchers at the University of Glasgow), Ana will talk about the Indicative Data Science project that considers biases and missingness of data as useful data. 
They will also discuss how missing geospatial data such as blocked GPS signals can be used to create 3D maps and how to develop an inclusive crowdsourcing platform for Volunteering Geographic Information data collection. 
You can register to attend this event online: [https://tinyurl.com/gdsluog](https://tinyurl.com/gdsluog).

### Open Research Calendar

The [Open Research Calendar Events](https://openresearchcalendar.org) project has recently launched its newsletter to allow users to receive an automated newsletter summarising events that have been submitted to the Open Research Calendar. 
[Subscribe to their newsletter](https://openresearchcalendar.org/email-subscribe).
The project is led by Alexandra Lautarescu, Bradley J Kennedy, Cassandra D Gould van Praag,  and Esther Plomp, and they invite anyone interested to add details about their open science event via their [webpage](https://openresearchcalendar.org).

### hidden REF: Nominate someone for their hidden labour in research

The hidden REF is a friendly competition that recognises all research outputs and every role that makes research possible.
You can enter the competition by nominating yourself or someone vital to carry out your research: [https://hidden-ref.org/submissions/](https://hidden-ref.org/submissions/).
The [submission categories](https://hidden-ref.org/categories/) are crowdsourced to construct a broad set of categories that will recognise everyone who contributes to the success of the research.
Submissions will close on 14th May 2021. 
They will be reviewed by panels drawn from across the research community and winners will be announced in June 2021.

![Submission to the Hidden REF is easy. We are asking for a 300-word summary outlining the contribution to research and there are 21 categories to choose from.](images/2021-04-hiddenref-3.jpg)
