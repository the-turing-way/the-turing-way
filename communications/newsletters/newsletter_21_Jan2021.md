The Turing Way Newsletter: 21 January 2021

# New year wishes from The Turing Way and plans for 2021!

Happy New Year Turing Way friends!  

Needless to say that 2020 was a tough year and did not exactly go as we had planned. But, that should not stop us from planning (hoping and dreaming) for 2021. 🌻

This year, as most of us continue to work from home during the pandemic, we want to:

-   🌍 **Strengthen and provide additional support** for our network of contributors.
-   ☕️ **Facilitate collaborative efforts** in the community by hosting coworking calls and events.
-   🏆 Support you in representing _The Turing Way_ to **highlight your work and resources**.
-   🌸 **Welcome your thoughts and ideas** on how we as a community project can support you.
-   🗣 **Create more opportunities to listen** to new voices and bring in their perspectives.

We look forward to seeing and welcoming you to our community spaces and events.
You can reach out to the team by emailing [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com), open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues), or directly contact Malvika Sharan and Kirstie Whitaker on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw).

### Join the Spanish Translation Team on Mondays
Camila Rangel-Smith and Raina Camacho Toro are hosting coworking sessions every Monday at 17:00 UTC to work on the [Spanish translation of the book](https://www.transifex.com/theturingway/theturingway/).
Connect with them on the Slack channel #traducción-español ([Slack invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw)) to receive rolling invites to join in their effort.

## News from the community

### Support for Representing _The Turing Way_ at Conferences

Thanks to Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp, Ismael Kherroubi-Garcia, Laura Ación, Laura Carter, Marilina Santero, Martina Vilas, Paul Owoicho, Sarah Gibson and Sophia Batchelor for representing _The Turing Way_ in 2020 through talks and presentations! 
To keep this tradition going and further build a sense of ‘shared ownership', we welcome you to suggest 2021 events that you would like to attend and where you can share about your work in _The Turing Way_.

You can reply in the GitHub [issue #1717](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1717) or reach out to Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).
We have created a [promotion pack](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/communications/promotion-pack) linked with frequently asked questions and presentations that you can adapt for your use (and in your preferred language). 
We would be happy to give 1:1 feedback on your talk and will be able to provide support towards paying the conference registration fee.

### Opportunities to Lead Small Projects Within the Community

We have collected a set of project ideas beyond co-authoring chapters in the book that new and existing contributors can lead in _The Turing Way_. 
These ideas include small-scale tasks such as guest-authoring newsletters or assessing _The Turing Way_’s community health and topics that are at the meta-study level such bringing Data Feminism Perspective to the project or creating reproducible translation pipeline to support community’s translation efforts.

We have proposed these projects to provide leadership opportunities that our community members can use while developing a new skill or idea that they haven't yet had a chance to explore.
Even though these projects can be carried out independently, we encourage and promote collaboration with other members and connect with ongoing projects in the community.
Please see [issue #1712](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1712) for details and add more ideas.

![This illustration shows on the left-hand side that the traditional acknowledgement system is broken that can unfairly treat people. On the right-hand side, it shows how we try to acknowledge them fairly in _The Turing Way_. We have a contributors bot that catches all the contributors information and stores them in contributors record](images/2021-01-Acknowledgement2.jpg)

### A GitHub Action for Contributors Record
_The Turing Way_ maintains a contributors record in the [book’s Afterword](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record.html). 
This record combines the contributors' table and the personal impact statements of our contributors as described in the [acknowledgement chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement.html).
We have now added a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) in our workflow that automatically updates this record every week (see [the workflow](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/workflows/contributors-record.yml)).
Thanks to Martina G. Vilas and Sarah  Gibson for their support in setting this up.

*This is a good chance to remind you to add your bio and impact statement in the [contributors.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) file if you have not done that already.
We would be delighted if you can pass this information to previous contributors in your network who might want to share their personal highlights in the project.*

## Relevant Resources

### Contribute to Writing and Reviewing Chapters
We have a few chapters currently being written or waiting to be reviewed that can use some extra support.
Particularly we invite you to review subchapters on scientific outreach ([PR #1709](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1709), preview [on Netlify](https://deploy-preview-1709--book.the-turing-way.org)), contribute to the leadership chapter ([PR #1553](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1709), preview [on Netlify](https://deploy-preview-1553--book.the-turing-way.org)) or review the translated versions of README file (see PRs [#1586 for Arabic](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1586) and [#1470 for Polish](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/1470) translations).

[Emma Karoune](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record.html#emma-karoune) is an independent post-doctoral researcher working in the field of Environmental Archaeology and Palaeoecology. 
She has a PhD in Palaeoecology from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London.
She is currently working on a project with Historic England concerning the development of novel methodologies in phytolith research for application to British Archaeological remains. 
She is also working on a project to improve the FAIRness of phytolith data.
In her words:
> I try to work as openly as possible and a large part of my current research is developing easy and accessible to all collaborative and open ways of working. I am also working hard to bring together specialists in my field into a working group for Open Science so that we can work collaboratively towards subject-specific FAIR guidelines for phytolith data. 

> I have really enjoyed working in such a collaborative way [in _The Turing Way_] during the November 2020 Book Dash. I have had interesting discussions concerning the accessibility of this project and research in general with other contributors. 
>I have further developed my Github skills by working in collaboration with others while drafting a chapter on [Getting Started with GitHub](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/github-novice.html) and enhance the [online Glossary](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/glossary.html) that now maintains a list of all definitions in Afterword.
