## Community News and Updates

### The *Turing Way* at AIUK 2023

AIUK, hosted in London by the Alan Turing Institute on the 21st and 22nd March offered an in-depth exploration of how data science and AI can be used to solve real-world challenges. 
*The Turing Way* engaged with the attendants in several ways:

![Alt: photo of the The Turing Way stand at AIUK. A large lightbox and banner has The Turing Way logo as a backdrop, with a screen projecting the handrawn 'guide for collaboration' image by scriberia that features visible and invisible aspects of collaboration. There are a black sofa and black square table (with many stickers) on the left, one white circular coffee table with lots of different stickers on it on the the right, and two white chairs.](https://i.imgur.com/EfX6Qfn.jpg)

## The *Turing Way* Practitioners Hub Update

After more than four years of building open resources with a diverse community of researchers and practioners, *The Turing Way* has started the Practitioners Hub programme in 2023, which aims to extend the impact of the project.
The Practioners Hub will be a forum for **cross-sector engagement**, **knowledge exchange** and **strategic collaboration** with organisations across academia, research, engineering systems, government, and healthcare **leading data science initiatives**. 

![Alt: Image titled "Big Team Science: Collaborative and Inclusive Research" promoting collaborative and inclusive research: with different teams working together: "Accelerated Problem solving" features a person driving, "Skill Building" features an arm holding a wrench, "Share Challenges and Solutions" features two people discussing together, "Improve ways of working and build collaborative research around the world" features a network map, "Working with stakeholders from different sectors" features a person interacting with different types of people.](https://i.imgur.com/xunko9w.png)

*Image by The Turing Way community and Scriberia. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3332807](https://zenodo.org/record/7587336#.ZCbPXrTMJXU)*

Funded by UKRI, the programme will be piloted with five leading organisations in the UK to **build a shared understanding of open science, reproducibility, accessibility and research ethics**, promoting quality.
Future cohorts will be planned to engage internationally to promote practices for enhacing quality, rigour and integrity in data science and AI.

The *Practitioners Hub* is a 3-year programme funded by the *Ecosystem Leadership Programme (UKRI funded)* and *Bridge AI* (more info below).

### Bridge AI Launch

**The ¬£100M *Bridge AI* programme**, sponsored by *Innovate UK*, will be having its launch event on 26 April 2023, in London.

*BridgeAI* (Innovate UK KTN (ktn-uk.org)) aims to help businesses in high growth sectors such as agriculture, construction, creative and transport industries, to harness the power of AI and unlock their full potential. **The Practitioner Hub** will extend the impact of *The Turing Way* community-led approaches and resources to those sectors.

### üì¢ NASA/TOPS: Seeking Open Science Success Stories

[The Transform to OPen Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) team, that several *The Turing Way* members contribute to, is dedicated to promoting and advancing **open science, especially in relation to climate change**. 
To demonstrate the impact of open science, **they are seeking compelling scientific discoveries or advances that would not be possible without open science** (data, software, tools, or sharing results) are compelling to a broad, diverse, public audience. 
They want to showcase more open science based scientific discovery success stories for Earth Day.
They are also interested in **stories that highlight the contributions of citizen scientists (using NASA data or funding)**. 
An example of what we are looking for is [here](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3201/climate-patterns-thousands-of-miles-away-affect-us-bird-migration/) and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/the-birds-in-the-cloud-how-the-university-of-oklahoma-uses-nexrad-data-to-study-birds/).

**Submit your stories [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions/categories/open-science-stories).**
Science results that you share with them **by 4 April 2023 have the best chance of being a part of Earth Day**.
