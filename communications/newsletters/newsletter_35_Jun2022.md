* üî• Tune in to our upcoming **Fireside Chat on 30 June at 15:00-16:00 UTC** - we will be speaking with four members of our community about their work and how they collaborate on the project.
* ‚òï Join our next **Collaboration Cafe on 6 July from 14:00-16:00 UTC**.
* üå± Check out the **Community News** section to learn more about what we have been up to this month!
* üíº **Opportunities in *The Turing Way* Orbit** has roles, events, and calls for submissions that might be of interest.

If you're interested in keeping up with the community in real time, don't forget that you can always join our [Slack workspace](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack) or follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turingway).

## Upcoming Events

![Alt:Flier for Fireside Chat event for June details for which is provided below in text](images/2022-06-fireside-chat.jpg)

### Upcoming Fireside Chat üî•

This June, we're hosting our Fireside Chat on **Reflections, Replications and Perspectives from *The Turing Way*" on Thursday 30 June, 15:00-16:00 UTC** ([see in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-06-30/16:00)).
Chaired by Malvika Sharan and Anne Lee Steele, this panel will feature insights from **Patricia Herterich, Emma Karoune, Andrea S√°nchez-Tapia and Alejandro Coca-Castro**.
These individuals take on different roles in *The Turing Way* and more broadly in data science communities that promote best practices for open, reproducible and inclusive research.
Join us, and [sign up on Eventbrite here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reflections-replications-and-perspectives-from-the-turing-way-tickets-368582268487).

We also have some exciting conversations coming up in July and August - stay on the lookout for details!

### Community Events

As usual, we have several recurring community calls happening this month.
Don't forget: **all are welcome to these calls, no sign-up is needed!**

#### Collaboration Cafes ‚òï

This month, **Collaboration Cafes** are being hosted on 6 and 20 July 2022.
As always, these calls are places for co-working, discussion, onboarding, and collaboration.
They take place from 14:00 - 16:00 UTC ([see in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-06-15/15:00)).

**Weekly coworking calls** are hosted every Monday from 11:00 - 12:00 London time ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-06-23/15:00)).
These calls are accountable spaces for coworking on your contributions or discussing your idea for *The Turing Way*.
Find the joining link on this shared HackMD: hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-calls.

#### Translation and Localisation Weekly Meetings üíªüè°

The Translation and Localisation team hosts weekly open calls at 16:00 BST ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-06-21/16:00)).
These calls are for co-working on translation and localisation efforts across several different languages, and for learning more about the work of the team.
Welcome to Abdulrahman Dallak, Abdulrahman Alswaji, Jafsia Elisee, Melissa, and Pamela for joining the team's translation efforts in Arabic, French, and Spanish!
For more information, join the #translation channel on [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack), and this [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@1PPG0ptkTeW_qYfRy5S42Q/HJjYITE_c/edit).

### Open Life Science Training and Mentoring: Applications Open!

Open Life Science (OLS) is a 16-week mentoring and training program that upskills individuals in open and reproducible research and empowers them to become open science ambassadors in their communities.
Following five successful cohorts, supporting 147 projects and 251 project leads, the sixth cohort, OLS-6, is open for application until July 7, 2022.
Please see the OLS website (https://openlifesci.org) for details.

We collaborate with OLS, under the partnership name [OLS for Turing](https://openlifesci.org/ols-6#collaborators) and provide a unique opportunity for our community members to integrate best practices in new or ongoing projects within and outside *The Turing Way*.
OLS offers microgrants to all participants to ensure that they can equitably participate in the program (see the [promotion pack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQHmvjgJwKLUu_SLhGBwzK_8y_TNXROOVJgUTM8s9RX9h_sxQQEvIy-faITVmboVVsK8YfG8etwJcne/pub) for details).

## Community News

### Book Dash Report

![Alt:Screenshot of Book Dash Planning Committee](images/2022-06-bookdash-planners.jpg)
_Thank you to the Book Dash Planning Committee (left to right), Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune, Laura Carter, Esther Plomp, Lena Karvovskaya, and Carlos Martinez, who also hosted local hubs in London and Amesterdam. Thanks to Anne Lee-Steele and Achintya Rao, who hosted a local hub in Bristol!_

As always, it was a busy and beautiful week for Book Dash attendees!
We had 29 participants across 5 time zones, who collaborated and worked on many new and ongoing projects, details for which are shared in our [Book Dash Report](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-may2022).

Book Dashes have become important for creating space for our community to come together to work on chapters, collaborate with others, and connect from across the world.
We know that attending synchronous events across time zones may not always be possible for everyone, and hence, are so grateful for the time and care you put into your contributions.

### Community Share-outs

![Alt:screenshot of community share-out number 1](images/2022-06-shareout1.jpg)
_Screenshot of Community Share-out 1!_

On 20 May, we hosted two Community Share-out and Contributor Celebrations events.
These sessions were beautiful spaces, full of people sharing their work and accomplishments during Book Dash (our bi-annual [contributor event](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html)), and invited others to collaborate.

Thank you to Aida Mehonic, Alejandro Coca-Castro, Andrea S√°nchez-Tapia, Anne-Claire Fouilloux, Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp, Florencia D‚ÄôAndrea, Georgia Aitkenhead, Hari Sood, Iman Al Hasani, Jennifer Ding, Jim Madge, Johanna Bayer, Laura Carter, Marta Mangiarulo, Patricia Herterich, Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal, Stephanie van de Sandt, and Timothy Sum Hon Mun for attending, for sharing your work, and being a part of our beautiful community. :heart:

For more about what people got up to throughout the week (it was a lot!), check out this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1527603875901063168).
Anne also shared a quick update on community research (slides available here: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6620832](https://zenodo.org/record/6620832#.YqhWYJDMKUs)).

_Congratulations to Asma!_

Congratulations to [Asma Kacem](https://asmakacem.me/), who will be joining the Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia to translate chapters of *The Turing Way* into Arabic, and develop a glossary for key terms in open science.
Asma will be co-mentored by Dalya Hisham, with the program coordinated and led by Batool Almarzouq throughout this summer.
You can learn more about the [Outreachy program here](https://www.outreachy.org/).

‚ú® **Meet Asma Kacem** ‚ú®

## Ongoing Projects and Invitations to Collaborate

### First Core/Organising Team meeting

We hosted our first organisational team meeting on Friday, 10 June with 20 volunteers and staff members who serve as members of *The Turing Way* Core Team. Governance has been an ongoing topic within the community for a long time.
This meeting was a way for us to communicate and build accountability for the open, decentralised and equitable decision-making processes we would like to establish for the long-term sustainability and respectful co-creation in *The Turing Way*.

Malvika and Anne have been documenting this work through the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program, as documented on this [Pull Request on Github](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/issues/31).

### Mini Working Group: Communications

From June through August, we will be piloting a small working group to gather feedback to improve *The Turing Way* Slack workspace and other communication channels.
This group is open to both new and long-term members of the project.
If you are interested in joining this group, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/kTu5rM1jCxhXrckG8).

### Community Research Updates

Anne posts [regular updates on this Github Issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2318).
If you'd like to get involved in the process or talk to her more about it, reach out to her directly on Slack or by [email](mailto:asteele@turing.ac.uk).
