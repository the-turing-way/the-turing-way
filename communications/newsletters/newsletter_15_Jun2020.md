The Turing Way Newsletter: 17 June 2020

# Join Collaboration Café today, bring Data Feminism perspectives to _The Turing Way_ and learn how we can promote an equitable culture in our community!

Hello Turing Way friends!

The core team of _The Turing Way_ advocates for open and equitable research culture and is committed to supporting efforts against systemic inequality in the science and community at large.
To support the ongoing [Black Lives Matter movement](https://blacklivesmatter.com/), we urge our community members to understand the wider context, join calls for action and help each other learn ways to collectively stand in solidarity.

Join this week’s Collaboration Cafe today at 19:00 BST ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-06-17/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)) and subscribe to the community calendar for the future events.

We have recently updated the format of our [online book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/) to facilitate easy navigation of its chapters on research reproducibility and provide dedicated locations for new guides for project design, communication, collaboration and ethical research.
If you would like to report any bug or error, or suggest useful ideas for improving accessibility, please comment under the [issue #1220](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1220).

If you have been reading the Data Feminism book by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein, join our effort to capture your perspective and lessons learned in _The Turing Way_’s guide for Ethical Research ([issue #1205](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1205)).

Stay safe!

## Recommended resources for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement

The [Black Lives Matter movement](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/) and its ongoing protests demand us to have informed and sensitive discussions on history, race, science and society to take necessary actions as individuals against systemic injustice.
We believe that we can support this movement authentically only when we educate ourselves on these issues more widely.
Therefore, we are highlighting [this list of curated resources](https://lectureinprogress.com/journal/resources-for-supporting-black-lives-matter-movement) by [lectureinprogress.com](https://lectureinprogress.comt) that covers a range of topics from history, philosophy, race, allyship, mentoring and training.
We urge you to learn from and share relevant educational resources (like books, videos, and podcasts, calls for actions, and organisations to support), recognise our privilege (and lack thereof) and use our platforms to raise voice against systemic inequality.

## Community meetings

### Collaboration Café

We have a Collaboration Café today at 19:00 BST ([your local time](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-06-17/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)).
You can sign up on this HackMD to indicate your participation: [https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe).

In this coworking call, we would love to onboard new members who have recently joined the community and would like to know where they can get involved.
We would also like to discuss how we can continue hosting these calls in the future to accommodate the need from the community and the team members.

### Daily coworking calls
During the lockdown, while many of us are working from home, we have also been hosting 1-hour short coworking calls.
Unlike the Collaboration Café, these calls take place almost every day during the week and offer a space to work on ideas for The Turing Way and seek support from the core members of the _The Turing Way_.
You can sign up every week to indicate your participation in this HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking).

## News from the community

### New Book Format

We overhauled _The Turing Way_ book to make it easy to browse, read and contribute to.
You will now find the dedicated locations for guides for [Reproducible Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html), [Project Design](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-design.html), [Communication](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/communication.html), [Collaboration](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/collaboration.html) and [Ethical Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/ethical-research.html).
You will also be able to read and write chapters useful for maintaining and supporting our community in the [community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html).
You can visit the online book at [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/).

Followed by a recent upgrade of [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/), we have been able to bring about the recent changes while simplifying the backend infrastructure that hosts the book on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
Consequently, our [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) have also been updated to include ways to cite and cross-refer chapters within the book.
Thanks to the numerous community members for their support that has helped us achieve this major milestone in the project.
If you notice any error or bug that might have been introduced due to this update, please report them under the [issue #1220](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1220).

### Data Feminism meets _The Turing Way_

[Data Feminism](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism) explores current practices within data science and asks us to recognise and act on the role that power plays throughout research processes, from data collection and storage to communication and visualisation.
On 4 June, The Alan Turing Institute hosted a webinar with the authors of [Data Feminism](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism), Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein, which was attended by around 700 attendees.
Through seminars like this, their weekly reading group and community engagements over the last months, the authors have not only shed light on imbalanced power structures underlying data science but have started active and timely discussions around research ethics.

Inspired by their work, we want to welcome and support interested participants, readers, and users of Data Feminism to contribute to _The Turing Way_.
Specifically, we invite contributions to build new chapters with recommendations, best practices, case studies, and impact stories inspired and shaped by Data Feminism in _The Turing Way_'s Guide to [Ethical Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html).
You can join the discussion but comment on [the Github Issue #1205](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1205).

## Tips & Tricks for new contributors

### Contributor in focus: Heidi Siebold

[Heidi Siebold](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold) is a medical AI researcher, research software engineer and open science expert at LMU Munich, Bielefeld University and the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich.
She develops machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
Her passion for open and reproducible research has led her to join the Turing Way community.
She co-authored two chapters [Research Compendia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia.html) and [File Naming Convention](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/filenaming.html) in _The Turing Way_ during and after her participation at the Book Dash in February 2020.
Ever since, she has been engaging with other community members through reviewing and editing new contributions, and participating in community discussions through GitHub.
In her words:
> I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research).
> I spend most of my time identifying ways to improve the way we do research while supporting, teaching and contributing to open projects such as _The Turing Way_.
> In the long term, I would like to create an online course on reproducible data science with _The Turing Way_ as a basis.

### Learn how to use Binder with “Zero to Binder” tutorials

Tim Head from the [BinderHub project](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/) has written a tutorial called [Zero to Binder](https://github.com/Build-a-binder/build-a-binder.github.io/blob/master/workshop/10-zero-to-binder.md) to help learners get started with using BinderHub (the software behind mybinder.org).
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide with examples from Python scripts.
Recently, our core community member Sarah Gibson has co-written versions of this tutorial with Anna Krystalli called [From Zero to Binder in R!](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-r.md), and with Oliver Strickson and Alex Bird called [Zero to Binder in Julia!](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder-julia.md) to support new learners who are more comfortable with using R and Julia respectively.

### Recommendations for starting a new community online

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, computational communities have been asynchronously organising hackathons, data modelling projects, task forces, and working groups.
Even though this is a unique chance to establish new collaborations and start a meaningful project, it is equally important to ensure that the teams and communities around these projects are built on the foundation of excellent science and community practices.
Here is [a post on 10 community practices](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-05-26-cw20-speed-blog-bootstrapping-development-team-during-time-crisis) that can help build an effective online team or community, especially to ensure that a positive culture of collaboration is fostered.
This blog was posted on [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk), and co-authored by Malvika Sharan, Yo Yehudi, Colin Sauze, Raniere Silva, Robert Haines and Claire Wyatt, under the mini-blog series.

### Lessons from remote meeting to take back to the office

If you are preparing to go back to your office after working remotely for the last 3 months, give this post a read: [3 lessons from remote meetings we’re taking back to the office](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/remote-meetings).
This blog was posted by opensource.com and authored by project leads of Mozilla Open Leaders, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes and Chad Sansing, and the OpenScapes community lead Julia Stewart Lowndes.
They describe how using a welcoming tone, developing robust documentations and choosing right tools that we have been using while working from home can make real-life meetings better and more inclusive when we get back to the office.

### Binder workshop

On 11 June 2020, _The Turing Way_ team members Kirstie Whitaker, Sarah Gibson and Malvika Sharan delivered a [Binder workshop for research reproducibility](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) in collaboration with [UKDRI](https://ukdri.ac.uk/).
Attended by 25 participants, this half-day workshop introduced attendees to _The Turing Way_ project and discussed the importance of reproducibility when sharing codes online.
The second part of the workshop was a hands-on session for using Binderhub on a test GitHub repository, which was followed by a group exercise to work on real case examples from their own research.

We thank the UKDRI members, I-Chun Lin and Emilia Danielewska for hosting this workshop and taking care of all the tasks that went into organising this event online.
