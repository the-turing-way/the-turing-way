The Turing Way Newsletter: 08 December 2021

# Three years of The Turing Way project, highlights from our community and holiday wishes!

Hello Turing Way friends!

How have you been? 🌻

We have been a little bit busy.
In the past few months, we recruited and onboarded new project members, launched a new Fireside Chat series, ran the sixth edition of Book Dash and planned some strategic directions for *The Turing Way* for the next year. 🎊

Hopefully, that explains why newsletters from the last two months did not make it to your mailbox (and a long one this time). 😅

Like every year, in the last newsletter of 2021, we want to take time to review the year and express our gratitude to you for being an integral part of *The Turing Way*, especially amidst the pandemic this year. 

Find our little ‘thank you’ notes and updates from the community in the newsletter below. 👇

## Community meetings

### Fireside chat: Shared Concerns in Open Research Communities

On 10 December 2021, 17:00 - 18:00 UTC, the next fireside chat will take place on the topic "Shared Concerns in Open Research Communities". 
We have allocated 30 minutes after the session (18:00 - 18:30 UTC) to have open discussions with attendees and hear their reflections on the topic.
[Register to join the conversation](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-shared-concerns-in-open-research-communities-tickets-217634158627?keep_tld=1).
The session host Malvika Sharan will welcome Emmy Tsang, Kate Hertweck, Tiago Lubiana, Humberto Julio Debat and Melissa Mendonça.
They will bring their combined perspectives as community builders, educators, trainers, mentors, researchers and facilitators of open and reproducible practises at both local and global scales.
We invite you to host and lead future fireside chats in your network.
[Connect with us](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#get-in-touch) to discuss more.

### Collaboration Cafe

The last Collaboration Cafe of the year 2021 is taking place on **15 December 2021 from 15:00 - 17:00 UTC**.
Join our project members and core contributors to introduce yourself, about your interests in research and how we can work together.
If you haven’t yet managed to connect with *The Turing Way* community, this would be a good opportunity.
Find more details about the event and sign up on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe).
We will restart these calls on **19 January 2022**.

### Coworking call

Same as the Collaboration Cafe, the last coworking call of this year is on 13 December from 11:00 - 12:00 UTC.
Please register on [thus HacMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call.
Next year, we will return on 10 January 2022 with our weekly coworking calls (Mondays).

### Take Visible Roles in *The Turing Way*

![](images/2021-12-pathway-3.jpg)

As we finish three years of *The Turing Way*, we are reflecting on our growth, both as a project, communities and breadth of research interests people represent.
We have started working on our next [governance model](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/2036) to ensure that the voices and ideas we represent as a community are present in the visible roles and decision-making processes.

Many of our community members deliver talks and workshops regularly ([see details](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way/)), but representation within the community spaces is still limited to the core team.
We want to learn about how we can support more people in hosting events (like Book Dash, Collaboration Cafes or Coworking Calls), leading fireside chats, documenting case studies that reflect their domains, delivering 'just in time' workshops and offering mentorship.
Would you like to take one of these roles or have different ideas to enhance our community member’s visibility? 
Please contact us via one or multiple channels described in the [contribution guideline](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
You can also comment under [issue #2030](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2230)

### New Releases and Release workflow of The Turing Way

We have made the latest release of *The Turing Way* on Zenodo that can be cited as “The Turing Way Community. (2021). The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research (1.0.1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5671094”.

During the Book Dash, Malvika with contributions from Carlos and Achintya documented the [release workflow](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/release-workflow.md) to facilitate regular releases by our project members.
To keep it manageable with the growing number of contributors to the project, we have attributed this release without individual author names, which are maintained in the [Record of Contributions in the Afterword](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html) of the book.

### Capture Your The Turing Way Contributions

#### Not a Contributor but Use The Turing Way? Tell us about it!

If you're not already involved in the community as contributors and you use, share or build upon the project, book or community in any way - We would love to hear from you too!
For example, many people use the online repository structure in their projects, develop the reproducibility plan using our chapters, reuse the Code of Conduct for their projects, cite *The Turing Way* in their manuscripts or grant proposals, and promote our community practises. 
You can see more responses to [Kirstie's Tweet](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1326126705270984710?s=20) from the last year and share your response with us under [issue #1659](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1659).

### New Set of Illustrations
As always, our Book Dash participants had an opportunity to work with Scriberia Artists on their chapter and research ideas they were collaborating on.
This time we had Katya Balakina and Matt Kemp available for three days working with us on some day-to-day concepts such as documentation, authorship, public engagement, recognition and collaboration, as well as complex topics such as community management, data stewardship, research infrastructure, code publication, peer review and translation workflow.
We also managed to document some Turing Way specific illustrations such as the history, vision and fire chat.
Do check them out, and share them in your work and cite them as *The Turing Way Community, & Scriberia. (2021). Illustrations from the Turing Way book dashes. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807* (like we are doing in this newsletter! 😇).

## News from the community

### New Project Members and Ways of Working

Over the last months, we have been working with the teams of Community Managers and Research Application Managers at The Alan Turing Institute, under the [Tools, Practices and Systems research programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) led by Kirstie Whitaker.
These members will be formally dedicating a part of their position to sustain the development and support work in *The Turing Way*.
With their onboarding, we have updated the list of project members in the [ways of working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) document.
We are thrilled to have Emma Karoune, Aaron Lacey, Achintya Rao, Vicky Hellon, Aida Mehonic, Arielle Bennett, Alden Conner and Jennifer Ding joining the project in a paid capacity.
We are also grateful for the continued investment and in-kind support of Carlos Martinez (Netherlands eScience Center), Esther Plomp (Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Delft University of Technology) and Sarah Gibson (2i2c and JupyterHub).

### UX/UI Enhancement of The Turing Way
 
![](images/2021-12-doors-7.jpg)

*The Turing Way Community, & Scriberia. (2021). Illustrations from the Turing Way book dashes. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807*

Since the launch in 2019, over 300 contributors have co-authored more than 250 pages in *The Turing Way*  book describing data science practices on reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design and research ethics.
The project is used by thousands of users each month and cited across different projects within and outside the Turing.
Since the chapters continue to increase, it became essential for us to offer appropriate ways for our users to discover relevant and desired content in the book based on their topics of interest and skill levels to ensure we maximise the accessibility, reusability, and therefore impact, of the resources created by data scientists and researchers.
To enable this work, we received additional funding to work with the members of the Research Engineering Group at The Alan Turing Institute (see [full proposal](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/2231)).
We are exploring different prototypes that are carefully developed and tested by the project members May Yong, Lydia France and Iain Stanson.
You can follow the updates and join the discussion under [issue #2071](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2071).

Collaboration with the Open Life Science continued to offer mentorship and training to *The Turing Way* community members. See [June’s newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/success-stories-from-book-dash-collaborations-videos-from-past-events-more-community-updates).
-   **July**: Multiple positions and The Alan Turing Institute were announced with allocated time to work on *The Turing Way*. Due to low demand, we stopped hosting onboarding calls and opened a call to suggest what kinds of community calls we can host to engage with members who would like to stay involved but haven’t found a way to engage yet. See [July’s newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/new-job-opportunities-community-call-plans-chapters-and-other-updates).
-   **August**: The JupyterHub team members partnered with *The Turing Way* to support the Community Lead Strategic position funded under the Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) for Science funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). See [August’s newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/monthly-round-ups-upcoming-events-jupyterhub-community-strategy-partnership-and-more-updates).
-   **September**: Malvika was promoted to co-lead *The Turing Way* as the Tools, Practices and Systems Senior Researcher, and a job opening was announced for the recruitment of a new community manager. See [September’s newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/we-are-hiring-meet-us-at-the-fireside-chat-community-share-out-and-contributor-celebration-date).
- **October**: The Fireside Chat series was kicked off with the first event on the topic “what exactly is *The Turing Way*” to discuss the project’s origin story and a vision for *The Turing Way*. Watch the [video featuring Cassandra Gould van Praag, Kirstie and Malvika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k).
-   **November**: The sixth edition of *The Turing Way* Book Dash was hosted (as reported in this newsletter), new releases of the book with the entire repository were made and new Project Members were onboarded in the project. Read about our project members and learn about our [ways of working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md).
-   **December**: We are ending the year with nearly 308 GitHub contributors, 570 newsletter subscribers and nearly 2500 Twitter followers. We have together released 30 chapters, nearly 300 pages with chapters including modular subchapters, templates and several supporting resources across our five guides and a community handbook.

## Thank you & Holiday Wishes!

Thank you for contributing to *The Turing Way*, supporting and mentoring others in the community, sharing and building on the resources and representing the project through talks, posts and workshops.

Reflecting on how *The Turing Way* started as a funding proposal at a coffee shop, we are proud and humbled by the global collaboration it now represents.
The value *The Turing Way* brings to the broader space of open science, research and data science practice is possible only because of the diverse perspectives each of you have brought into the project.
