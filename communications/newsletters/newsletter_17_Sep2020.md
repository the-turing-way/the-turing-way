## News from the community

### Acknowledging our community members

We value and appreciate all the collaborative work that happens in _The Turing Way_, from fixing bugs to writing a chapter to hosting an event, and we are committed to acknowledging them all appropriately. 

Last week, we released the [Acknowledgement chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement.html) that describes our process of recording all the contributions and how we recognise them.
In this chapter, we provide details on how we create opportunities for shared ownership of this project and create a record of contributions with the [Contributor’s Table](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) and [contributors.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md) files.
These documents can be updated by all our contributors and used for highlighting their work in a manner that is most meaningful and useful for them.
We welcome all our past and current contributors to check our record and update it by adding details and personal highlights from their contributions in [contributors.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md).

*Read a detailed [thread by Kirstie Whitaker](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1303335123656626177?s=20) describing the main highlights from the Acknowledgement chapter*

### New chapters in the Community Handbook

We have 3 additional chapters in our [Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/community-handbook.html): [Monthly Newsletter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/newsletters.html), [Book Dash Events](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash.html), and [Community Coworking Calls](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coworking.html).
These chapters cover different community practices of _The Turing Way_ that will be helpful for our community members in their participation.
These are complemented by [various templates](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/templates.html) that can be easily reused, remixed and adapted by others.
Though written for _The Turing Way_ community, these resources will be useful for other Open Source community projects as well.

### 6 projects to be mentored and trained in Open Life Science

12 members from _The Turing Way_ and The Alan Turing Institute have joined the second cohort of Open Life Science with [6 projects](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/open-life-science-mentoring#ols-2-for-turing-projects) under the collaboration [OLS-2 for Turing](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators).

### Participating in the Google Season of Docs 

_The Turing Way_’s application has been accepted to involve a technical writer during this year’s [Google Seasons of Doc](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants).
You can read the [full proposal here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/project-incf-pgadige).
In this proposal we have set three major technical writing goals: 
1. Retrospective consistency across the entire book to create a coherent feel and style. 
2. Contributing to future maintenance by developing user documentation and guiding resources to support its contributors and maintainers. 
3. Improving the overall accessibility of the online book to improve access to information and its user-friendliness.

We will be looking into ways to collaborate with our community members in achieving these goals as our technical writer develops and leads initiatives within _The Turing Way_.

## Contributor in focus: Ismael Kherroubi Garcia

[Ismael Kherroubi Garcia](https://twitter.com/IsmaelKherGar) is an Ethics Research Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute.
He has a BSc in Business Management and Administration and is currently working towards an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences.
Ismael has been working with _The Turing Way_ core team to engage the community of researchers in designing and developing the [Guide for Ethical Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/ethical-research.html).

In his words:
> Since my undergraduate degree, I have worked in fintech and then in arts organisations within human resources teams, finally reaching the Alan Turing Institute and helping support the Ethics Advisory Group.
> I think my highlight is that I've got a great background as a generalist!
> I am currently really thrilled to be working alongside [Laura Carter](https://github.com/LauraCarter) and [Sophia Batchelor](https://github.com/BrainonSilicon) to build a community around the Guide for Ethical Research!
> I am really fascinated by philosophical discussions about the social sciences, so I love the thought of questioning what an open science culture looks like and how to get there!
