# Community Calls and Updates

![Alt: Handrawn image by Scriberia that shows an iceberg floating in a sea, showing visible and invisible aspects of collaboration. Titled "There's more to Collaboration than you might think", the visible aspects are titled "different teams", "common goal", "exchange of knowledge", and "production". Invisible aspects are "treat each other kindly", "code of conduct", "inclusive workspace", "build diverse teams", and "explicitly open for contribution".](https://i.imgur.com/KvqT2dF.jpg)

## Help us plan our Community Calls for 2023!

![Alt: Grey slide with crackling orange fire overlayed onto it, with a title in large text that says "Help us plan the Fireside Chat for 2023". There are bullet points beneath the title that say: "Share your thoughts, Suggest a topic, Nominate a speaker, Co-design a future event, Host a language". A short description says: "Respond to a short survey: bit.ly/3WA8ILt or email theturingway@gmail.com". The Turing Way logo is on the left of the image: a teal and white arrow that has mathematical systems written on it. The Turing Way is handwritten in blue script around the arrow, with a hexagon shape drawn around it.](https://i.imgur.com/Z3GcPzA.jpg)

Take 5 minutes to fill out our feedback form and let us know what you'd like to see in 2023! 

**Please send your feedback by end of next week, 10 February** using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FLu-pUiTWc7_CfmoC4yGB_yN-IKBuqqqPigaxQYHlNE/edit). 
We encourage you to nominate yourself as a speaker/collaborator, and would love to learn from your perspectives and ideas in the coming year. 

## Attend the Turing's Annual AI-UK (21-22 March)

![Alt: Orange, pink and purple gradient, with "AI UK 2023: The UK's national showcase of data science and AI" in large sans-serif font in the centre. The AI UK logo and The Alan Turing Institute logos are at the bottom of the image, with a button saying "Secure your place"](https://i.imgur.com/ac2DBqN.png)

[AI-UK](https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/) is the UK's national showcase of data science and artificial intelligence (AI). 
Hosted by The Alan Turing Institute, AI UK 2023 will be an in-depth exploration of how data science and AI can be used to solve real-world challenges.

*The Turing Way* will have a booth at AI-UK this year led by the core team members, Emma Karoune, Anne Lee Steele, Esther Plomp, Vicky Hellon and Eirini Zormpa.
They will feature several interactive sessions to guide attendees through the project, showcase select chapters, and share more about our open ways of working.
*The Turing Way* members, Malvika Sharan and Bea Costa Gomez are hosting a panel with Kirstie Whitaker, Monica Granados and Mark Richards in the 'Research Stage'.

Learn more about [this event here, and grab your ticket](https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/) -- we hope you will join us either in person or online!

## Join us at the State of the Open Con (7-8 February)

![Alt: Black and white photo of the London Eye and Millenium Bridge. "State of Open Con 23" is written in multicoloured font, subtitled "The UK's Open Technology Conference: Open Source Software, Open Hardware & Open Data". In the even smaller text is "Queen Elizabeth II Centre, Parliament Square, London, 7-8 February 2023."](https://i.imgur.com/MKlG2VN.jpg)

Hosted by OpenUK in association with IEEE, State of the Open Con is the UK's first open technology conference.

Malvika Sharan will be speaking about "Investing in Research Infrastructure Roles for Cultural Change", and Emma Karoune and Anne Lee Steele will be organising an information booth at the conference. 
If you are attending, do stop by to learn more about *The Turing Way* project, and to meet a few members of the team!

[See the schedule](https://stateofopencon.com/schedule/) and [register for the conference](https://stateofopencon.com/) - there are some free community tickets that you can request by emailing the organisers.
