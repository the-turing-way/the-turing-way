## Our 10th Book Dash is happening in November!

On 13-17 November, we will be hosting our 10th Biannual Book Dash!

This is a special anniversary – our 10th Book Dash! 
Book Dashes are our primary contribution event within *The Turing Way* community, where people come together to work on all sorts of projects together throughout one week! 

This time around, we have contributors from more than 5 countries participating on topics related to accessibility, licensing, data hazards, infrastructure, project design, translation and localisation, data feminism, research software engineering, code review, algorithmic justice and more! 

We'll be hosting contribution sessions for the Americas and Asia/Pacific timezones, along with our current European/African timezones. 
For the first time we will be hosting some activities in Spanish. 

Thank you to the Book Dash Planning Committee, who have been hard at work to plan a fun week for all!

### Sign up for our Github training session on 6 November

As a part of Book Dash, we are offering a Github training session on 6 November, at 17:00 UTC. [See it in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-11-06/17:00/Github%20Training). 

In this workshop, co-facilitators from The Turing Way Community will introduce participants to using GitHub as a tool to support collaborative documentation-writing and knowledge sharing. 
They will discuss the importance of open community practices in building and maintaining collective resources, and learn about the importance of different roles in open source documentation communities like The Turing Way: including that of maintainers, reviewers, and translators. 

Participants will gain hands-on experience in working collaboratively during the workshop by contributing to the The Turing Way project. 
A shared document will be used for collaborative note-taking, capturing feedback and learning.

**[Sign up on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-github-training-session-nov-2023-tickets-736535025087?aff=oddtdtcreator)!**

### Join us at the Community Share-outs and Working Group Share-outs!

The Turing Way Community Share-outs and Contributor Celebration event will be the culmination of a week of collaboration at our bi-annual Book Dash event! 

**On 17 November 2023, The Turing Way team is hosting two Community Share-out and Contributor Celebration sessions at 11:00 [(in your time zone)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-11-17/11:00/11:00%20-%2013:00) and 17:00 [(in your time zone)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-11-17/17:00/17:00%20-%2019:00) London Time (UTC).** 
At these sessions, members of our community and Book Dash attendees will showcase their contributions to the book, share what they are working on and invite collaborations from the wider community. 
**[Sign up to join us on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-book-dash-community-share-outs-and-celebrations-nov-2023-tickets-735393400457?aff=oddtdtcreator)!**

In between these two sessions, at 14:00-15:00 London Time (UTC) [(in your time zone)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-11-17/14:00/14:00%20-%2015:00), ***The Turing Way* team will being hosting its third Working Group and Collaborators Share-out**, where working groups and collaborating projects share updates related to their work. 
If you are interested in signing up for that event, **[sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-working-group-and-collaborator-celebrations-nov-2023-tickets-744294955247).**

Everyone interested in The Turing Way project and our community is invited - please sign up to attend one, two, or all three of these sessions! 

### Contributions needed to the 10th Book Dash Celebration video

Have you partipated in a previous edition of *The Turing Way* Book Dash? Did you like the experience? 
Did you learn from it? **To celebrate the 10th edition of the Book Dash we will create a celebration video and we need you!**

In the following issue you will find how to contribute, with simple options such as sending us a short video or telling us how you will define the Book Dash in one word: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3330.

If you have questions or if you would like to receive a calendar invite to be recorded on Friday 10 November, email Alexandra at aaraujo.alvarez@turing.ac.uk or contact her through Slack.

We look forward to your contributions!

## A new Chapter on the Environmental Impact of Digital Research

A new sub-chapter on the Environmental Impact of Digital Research is now live! 

This chapter was incubated at Collaborations Workshop 2023 (#CollabW23), organised by [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) and first introduced by [Carlos Martinez](https://twitter.com/neocarlitos), [Loic Lannelongue](https://twitter.com/Loic_Lnlg)
and others as a blog: https://software.ac.uk/blog/2023-08-15-tracking-environmental-impact-research-computing

The writing and reviewing process took months of discussion and review, involving 15+ people who co-drafted, reviewed, discussed, & published this new chapter in Github pull requests, google docs, and other platforms

**Check out the chapter here: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/activism/activism-env-impact**

## Watch our September Fireside Chat

![Alt: Hand-drawn image by scriberia is on the right of the digital poster: three people are sitting around a fire whose flames form the words “The Fireside Chat”. They are holding speech bubbles on sticks in lieu of marshmallows. The talk is titled: “Who is building open source AI?” with subtitle “21 September, 14-15:30 UTC+1 – Register on Eventbrite”. There are black and white photos of 6 people who are co-organising and speaking at the Fireside chat: Arielle Bennett (Programme Manager, The Alan Turing Institute), Mophat Okinyi (Union Representative, African Content Moderators Union), Marzieh Fadaee (Senior Research Scientist, Cohere for AI), Abinaya Mahendiran (CTO, Nunnari Labs), David Gray Widder (Postdoctoral Fellow, Cornell Tech), Jennifer Ding (Senior Researcher, The Alan Turing Institute). Below: Hosted by/with TTW and the Open Source Initiative.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyrfSBRM6.png)

In September, we hosted a Fireside Chat on "Who is building open source AI?" on 21 September, 14:00-15:30 UTC+1. 
Facilitated by Jennifer Ding and Arielle Bennett, this panel featured highlights from Abinaya Mahendiran (Nunnari Labs) Marzieh Fadaee (Cohere for AI), David Gray Widder (Cornell Tech), and Mophat Okinyi (African Content Moderators Union). 
This Fireside Chat was organised as a part of the Open Source Initiative's Call for Defining Open Source AI.
