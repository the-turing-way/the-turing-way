### Collaboration Cafes 

Collaboration Cafes will take place on 04 August and 18 August 2021 from 15:00 - 17:00 London time ([see in your timezone](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/14)). 
In addition to the 'Pomodoro' co-working sessions, we will use this month‚Äôs Collaboration Cafe to review how these meetings have been for you over the last year.
We will also invite volunteers to host future calls and propose new ideas to make such events more sustainable and beneficial for you going forward.

Sign up and find more details in this shared HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe).

### Coworking Calls

Monthly coworking calls in August will take place every Monday from 11:00 - 12:00 London time ([see in your timezone](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/10)).
These calls have been a wonderful way for us to kick off our weeks by working with many of you on _The Turing Way_.
You are welcome to join if you would like to test, try and apply open, reproducible and collaborative aspects to any project of your choice.

Sign up and find more details in this shared HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call).

### Onboarding Calls 

Over the last three months, we have scheduled and hosted onboarding calls.
Unfortunately, they have not been effective at reaching members who are interested in using or contributing to _The Turing Way_ but don‚Äôt know where to start.
Therefore, we will not host onboarding calls from August onwards but plan a series of calls with a more suitable format  (discussed next).
You can always reach out to Malvika (email: msharan@turing.ac.uk) to set a 1:1 call or join one of the other events.

### Themed Community Calls - Help in Planning!

We are planning a series of Themed Community Calls from September 2021.
After discussing this with several members, we agreed that these calls will be a useful way to feature and celebrate the work carried out by our community members working on open and reproducible projects in and beyond _The Turing Way_.

Please volunteer to hosts a call, present something you are working on, or nominate someone you would like to invite at one of these calls using this form: [https://tinyurl.com/ttw-community-call](https://forms.gle/6CeGcqFJdQZ49uxR8).
It will take 3-5 minutes to complete this form - the deadline is **06 September 2021**.
We hope to share more details in the next newsletter, and cross-post them on Twitter and Slack workplace.

## News from the Community

### Kirstie Whitaker becomes the Turing‚Äôs Programme Director for Tools, Practices and Systems

We‚Äôre delighted to announce that [Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker) has moved from her role as Programme Lead to Programme Director of [Tools, practices and systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems).
Kirstie is the project lead of _The Turing Way_.
Last year, she became the Institute‚Äôs first Programme Lead for Tools, practices and systems with the intention of building the programme ‚Äì her new title acknowledges the growth of the programme and her role alongside it. 
Our heartiest congratulations to Kirstie on this new role.
In her words:

> "I've so enjoyed getting to know even more people around the Turing! 
> From talks on differential privacy in our monthly meet ups, Thursday coffee chats [at the institute] getting to meet new postdocs and learning about their projects, Collaboration Cafes with _The Turing Way_, and even having folks come to my office hours! 
> I hope I'll get to meet even more folks and promote collaborative and inclusive data science across the Institute.... and beyond!"

### Landing Pages Got New Looks!

![The top-tip box in _The Turing Way_ welcome page says ‚ÄúThe Turing Way is not meant to be read from start to finish. Start with a concept, tool or method that you need now, in your current work. Browse the different guides that make up the book, or use the search box to search for whatever you would like to learn first.‚Äù](images/2021-07-toptip.png)

*Screenshot from the current welcome page showing the ‚Äòtop-tip‚Äô*

Over the last 2.5 years, _The Turing Way_ as a project and a handbook have grown rapidly.
It is simply not possible to read all its content and therefore we recommend reading a chapter on a tool or practice that you are interested in or want to use in your work.

Thanks to the thoughtful contribution of Batool Almarzouq and Danny Garside who gave the [README](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) and the [welcome](the-turing-way.netlify.app) pages stunning new looks!
They harmonise how we provide information in these two locations and worked with Malvika to add images, top tips, and relevant information from the project.

### New Chapters and Updates from the Handbook

- **Overview of Project Design**: Don't know where to start your reproducible project journey from? 
Check out the [Overview chapter in the Guide to Project Design‚Äô]( https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/pd-overview.html).
Thanks to the massive curation and co-authoring work by Mariana Vivas that you can now find the most important references for designing and starting your research project in one single location.
Thanks also go to Nina di Cara for reviewing this chapter to ensure that information is provided in a structured manner.
There are five subchapters, each discussing different aspects such as collaboration, communication, version control, licensing, tool selection, documentation and publication.
 
- **Linking Research Objects**: Esther Plomp, among several other chapters in the book, has co-authored a chapter on [Making Research Objects Citable](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable).
She recently merged a new chapter, [Linking Research Objects](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html) that described how linking your data, code and article can ensure that your readers can find all research objects easily.
Approaches described in this chapter can help increase the visibility of your research outputs, while you receive credit for them.

- **Shared Ownership in Open Source**: Open source projects benefit from volunteer contributions and hence should share the "project ownership" with all stakeholders.
To further make a case for this argument, as well as provide ways to make that happen, Malvika wrote a chapter on [Shared Ownership](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/shared-ownership.html).
This is an extended version of a blog that she co-authored with Andrew Brown, Warrick Ball and Ben Krikler, that you can read on the [Software Sustainability institute‚Äôs blog]( https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2021-06-09-nudging-towards-better-default-open-source-project-ownership).

### Inviting Your Contributions!

We are sharing the following interesting issues in the project that we hope you can help us with:

![Image shows that different people look for different resources to learn, fix or use in their projects.](images/2021-07-tools.png)

*There are many ways you can learn, share and contribute to a project ‚Äì find the right starting point for you. _The Turing Way_ project illustration by Scriberia. Used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.*

- **Create an image gallery with illustrations**: Over the last five Book Dash events, we have generated re-usable illustrations that are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3332807).
They also exist in our [GitHub repository]( https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/website/figures) so that they can be easily linked to different chapters.
However, browsing them is not easy either on Zenodo or GitHub, which makes it hard for many people to find suitable illustrations that they can use or refer to in their work. 
If you know how we can visualise these illustrations in our online book, please comment under [issue #2046](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2046). 

- **Digital accessibility**: We recommend our contributors provide [alt text]( https://supercooldesign.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text) to describe their images.
However, we have also learned that not all image descriptions are effective for screen readers. 
We would like to invite you to review and update our existing alt text and help document tips to improve description as well as common mistakes to avoid.
Please see more details in [issue #2043](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2043).

- **UX/UI and design wishes**: With the growing number of chapters, we need to make sure that these resources are presented in a logical and meaningful way.
To address this, we will be working with the Turing Research Software Engineering team members to enhance the user experience aspect of _The Turing Way_.
For example, people with a different question might want to have a different starting point in the book, or they should be able to navigate curated sets of chapters based on user personas.
If you have similar, or even better ideas or any UX/UI wishes in _The Turing Way_, please comment under [issue #2034](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2034).

- **Translated versions of README files**: Since the English version of the README file has been updated, the translated versions in 8 languages (Korean, Dutch, French, Indonesian, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) need to be updated too. 
We would really appreciate any help with getting the new additions to the README file translate. 
Please find more details in [issue #2051](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2051).

Don‚Äôt find these issues interesting? Please browse more than 300 open issues on our GitHub repository.
You are welcome to [get in touch with Malvika](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk) if you have an idea and you don‚Äôt see them being discussed.

## Acknowledgements and Celebrations

### Contributor in Focus: FAIR Cookbook Project Team

[FAIR Cookbook]( https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook) is an online resource that helps researchers and data professionals make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).
The FAIR Cookbook goes beyond the ‚Äòaspirational‚Äô aspect of FAIR and practically guides researchers and data stewards in their FAIRification journey, and provide policymakers and trainers with practical examples to recommend in their guidance and training.
The FAIR Cookbook editorial board members, **Susanna-Assunta Sansone and Philippe Rocca-Serra** have collaborated with _The Turing Way_ members from the start to ensure interoperability between the two resources and exchange experiences as open source project developers.

![Image shows a woman reading data recipes from the FAIR cookbook and reproducing them in her project. This process is shown as a cookie baking process.](images/2021-07-faircookbook.png)

*FAIR Cookbook‚Äôs data recipes. _The Turing Way_ project illustration by Scriberia. Used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.*
 
FAIR Cookbook features relevant chapters from _The Turing Way_. 
Similarly, The Turing Way features the project and provides an impact story titled From FAIR Co-Author to FAIR Doer by Susanna-Assunta Sansone (a co-lead of the FAIR Cookbook project). 
To promote a culture of cooperation over competition among other open source projects, they wrote a chapter Leveraging the Turing Way Book sharing how a ‚Äúcollaborative meeting‚Äù at _The Turing Way_ Book Dash Bootstrapped the FAIR Cookbook project.
We encourage you to check out their [handbook](fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook) and contribute FAIR examples from your work.

- **Highlight your resources on _The Turing Way_**: _The Turing Way_ is a domain-independent handbook to data science and research practices.
We actively support and collaborate with projects, teams and organisations that are building upon The Turing Way and provide specific guidance in their fields. 
These projects are listed as [collaborating organisations and projects](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#collaborating-organisations-and-projects) and are actively highlighted in the community, such as the FAIR Cookbook.
Does your project use, reference and/or build upon _The Turing Way_? 
Please get in touch with us to discuss how we can highlight your project.
You can also comment under GitHub [issue #2017]( https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2017).
