## Community News and Updates


### Thanks to all the Book Dash contributors!

From 22-26 May 2023, *The Turing Way* hosted its 9th book dash. 
Thanks to the 37 participants that attended and worked collaboratively to submit 28 issues and 35 pull requests on topics ranging from open hardware to research ethics, to data feminism, to accessibility!

It has been an amazing week with opportunities to engage with our community and expand our network. 
We are thrilled by some of the comments received by the participants: 

"*Enjoyed collaborating with people from different parts of the world in creating content and also reviewing work done by others. I really like the way the Book Dash is structured as I get to participate in it while also working on other stuff throughout the week!*" 
(*Book Dash Participant, May 2023*)

"*I appreciate collaborating in real-time with people who have some of the same goals I do. We can make decisions and get some interactive things [done] much faster.  
I enjoy working with people from different backgrounds to we can get many perspectives on concepts like accessibility. 
The Book Dash helps me to focus and get things done that [I] didn't follow through with between BookDashes.*"

### **Welcome Arya**, a Google Summer of Code 2023 student who invites you to fill out a user survey!

We are excited to welcome Arya as a part of Google Summer Of Code 2023. 
She will be working on improving the usability of *The Turing Way* book by enhancing the user interface and creating a much better browsing experience based on different user profile.

Arya is a pre-final year undergraduate student of Computer Science Engineering with a specialisation in AI from Amrita University, India. 
She is a Python programmer and is interested in web development. 
She brings her experience working with React, Flask and Django. 

In her GSoC project with *The Turing Way*, she would like to know more about how different users navigate our guides, and where improvements are needed.

👉 Help her development work by filling out a **[short (2 mins) user survey](https://forms.gle/mDUpprm4UciRtdUh7)**.

![Alt: Close-up photo of Arya. She has brown skin and black hair, her lips are closed but she is smiling. She is wearing small earing in her left ear.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJiCddu8h.jpg)
