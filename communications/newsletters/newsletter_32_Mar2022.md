## Meet Anne Lee Steele, _The Turing Way_ Community Manager

We are delighted to welcome [Anne Lee Steele](http://twitter.com/aleesteele) as the Community Manager of _The Turing Way_. We asked Anne to share a few sentences about herself that you can read below.

![Anne Lee Steele's headshot](images/2022-03-aleesteele-01.png)

> I’m truly excited to join _The Turing Way_ community and to support such an important project in open science and the broader free/open ecosystem. Most relevant for the community, I’m an anthropologist by training… So in the coming weeks and months, I’ll be playing the role of an ethnographer, getting to know you all and _The Turing Way_, listening in, and learning how I can support you and your contributions to the project, whatever that may look like. I’ll be the first to admit that I’ll probably make mistakes along the way, but I’m excited to join you on this new chapter of _The Turing Way_ together.
> 
> I’ll be reaching out to people individually, but you will also see me in the slack channels, GitHub Pull Requests or Twitter. Please don’t hesitate to say hello! I’ve opened my calendar for (digital) coffee calls: [Book a chat with me](https://calendly.com/aleesteele/) or connnect [@aleesteele](http://twitter.com/aleesteele). There’s a lot I have to learn from you all, and I’m looking forward to getting to know you.

## Community Events

### Join us at the Fireside Chat on 25 March 2022

![Fireside chat's Flyer](images/2022-03-fireside-02.png)

On 25 March 2022, 17:00 - 18:30 UTC ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2022-03-25/17:00)), the next Fireside Chat's title is "Emergent Roles in Research Infrastructure & Technology". 
Chaired by Beth Duckles and Arielle Bennett, this panel will feature insights from Noor Shaker, Esther Plomp and Borhane (Bo) Blili-Hamelin. [Register on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-emergent-roles-in-research-infrastructure-technology-tickets-294499364527).

These individuals represent diverse positions in the research infrastructure and tech industry as community leaders, entrepreneurs, researchers and multi-talented professionals.
Drawing from their experiences, they will discuss what the career landscape currently looks like from their perspectives, why recognition for unconventional roles matters to them, and how we can work towards a culture that provides better opportunities for individuals who take the non-traditional academic route. 
We will also facilitate open discussions with attendees to learn about their perspectives on the topic via a shared document.

### Introduction to Data Science and AI Training : Review and Illustration Sprint

![The Turing Way Tweet inviting contributions to the training materials.](images/2022-03-turingcrick-04.png)

_Lydia France, Federico Nanni and Malvika are developing training materials for data science for biomedical researchers on GitHub (see an [early Tweet inviting case studies and examples](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1491849730996981770?s=20&t=RENtZhQDQ2WWCclDxxhjlA))_

On 28 and 29 April 2022 (1.5 days), we are organising a review and illustration sprint for the [Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience). 
Please express your interest to attend this event before **21 April 2022** via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/fXPZ9yPzMkqMxrdQ8).

This project has led to the development of **two training modules** on data science and AI practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs, and mid to late-career biomedical scientists. 
Therefore, we encourage anyone with overlapping experience in biomedical research and computational best practices with some project management skills to join us at this event. 
Participants can choose to attend from **five 2-hour long sessions for collaborative review** of these training materials. 
We will also work with a professional scribe from [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.com/) to help develop accessible illustrations during the event.

#### Pre-Event Webinar

We will host a webinar on 11 April at 17:00 (London Time) to present the project and answer any questions our applicants may have. 
Register in advance for this meeting: [https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrduGsqz0qEty19kV8JdA7e29AWkOgCYrM](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUrduGsqz0qEty19kV8JdA7e29AWkOgCYrM). 
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.
