### Collaboration Cafés

We had a chance to catch up with several of you at the *The Turing Way* Collaboration Cafés in the last weeks. 
Taking place **every month on the first and third Wednesday from 15:00 to 17:00 UTC** ([see in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2022-02-16/15:00/)), Collaboration Cafés are collaborative spaces for you to connect with *The Turing Way* team, share your ideas and exchange feedback.
These are also opportunities for us to onboard new members and share what we are working on.
Save the dates for the next calls on 16 February and 2 March.
Sign up on this shared HackMD: [hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/collaboration-cafe).

### Weekly Coworking Calls

We host weekly Coworking Calls **every week on Monday from 11:00 to 12:00** London time.
These meetings are often attended by folks working on *The Turing Way* issues or Pull Requests, leading on subprojects in collaboration with us or other projects where they use *The Turing Way* resources.
Find details about these calls in this shared HackMD and join us: [hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/coworking-call).

### Workshop: Facilitating Collaborative Sessions

Many of you expressed interest to host Collaboration Cafés or Coworking Calls but also indicated that you would like to attend a guided session on facilitating such events online.
Therefore, Malvika will be hosting two short **workshops on Facilitating Collaborative Sessions** such as those organised in *The Turing Way* community.
Please sign up by selecting one of the two sessions:

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

### Contributor in focus: Carlos Martinez-Ortiz 

Carlos Martinez is a 'Community Manager - Natural Sciences & Engineering' at the Netherlands eScience Center.
He has worked as an engineer in diverse projects in digital humanities and life sciences, developing expertise in natural language processing, linked open data and software sustainability. 
Carlos obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Exeter and worked on various research projects at the University of Exeter and Plymouth University before moving to the Netherlands. 
He is a certified Software Carpentry instructor and is frequently involved in organising training events.

As a member of *The Turing Way* core team, he supports researchers from eScience Center in sharing internally developed resources and recommended practices for the [Netherlands eScience Center guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/) to *The Turing Way*.

![Carlos Martinez's headshot](images/2022-01-carlos-4.png)

In his words:
> We always advocate for software reuse and collaborative development of software. 
> I love that we can do the same for software development guidelines: reuse content from the eScience guide and collaboratively develop with *The Turing Way* community!
> I am a big advocate of improving software quality. 
> I am really glad that the eScience Center is collaborating with *The Turing Way* in providing guidelines and helping build better research software.

Thanks to Carlos’ work at the organisation level.
We are using this example to **encourage documentation of internal practises** from different research teams and cross-reference them to *The Turing Way* **enabling community-led support and sustainability** for their work.

22 new Software Sustainability Institute Fellows have joined the fellows' network in 2022.
In addition, for the first time, four International Fellows were selected under the International Fellowship pilot! 
Two of these fellows are **Sophia Batchelor and Bastian Greshake Tzovaras** who are *The Turing Way* contributors and researchers collaborating on the [AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs) and [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) project. 
Congrats to all the fellows! Read [more about them](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/announcing-2022-software-sustainability-institute-fellows).

### Open Life Science Received Funding for 2022-2023

The [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org) training and mentoring programme have received two grants from the Wellcome Trust and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).
These fundings will enable research and sustainability of the program for the next two years.
Specifically, the Wellcome Trust Open Research Fund will enable the OLS team to conduct a research-based assessment, decolonisation and dissemination of our resources for their adoption and reuse across different open science communities.
CZI grant will provide OLS with a truly valuable opportunity to improve sustainability for the organisation and community by enabling a funded position that will focus on planning for the longer term.
Congratulations to the OLS team! 
Read details in [OLS' blogposts](https://openlifesci.org/posts).

### Next Building Laterally Event on 23 February

The Digital Infrastructure Incubator at Code for Science & Society has been hosting a Building Laterally Event Series.
**Building Laterally: Political Imagination to Support and Sustain Digital Infrastructure** events facilitate discussions on sustainability, governance, and community health in digital public infrastructure to wider political horizons.
The next event in the series is **Coloniality of Digital Infrastructure** which will take place online on 23 February.

### Open Research Calendar

We can't possibly announce all the exciting events our friends and colleagues are organising in open research and data science.
Nevertheless, you can find out about them (or add your events) on Open Research Calendar.
Open Research Calendar was created as a community-powered tool to serve the open research community in collating worldwide open research events into one database.
These events are added to a public Google Calendar that anyone can subscribe to and sync with their personal calendar.
Read more about the project and find links to their resources online at [openresearchcalendar.org](https://openresearchcalendar.org/).
