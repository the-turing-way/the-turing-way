![This illustration shows two people, one is a new contributor and another one is an experienced contributor. The experienced contributor takes the mentoring role and helps new contributor learn about the project so they feel empowered to contribute to the project](images/2020-12-mentored-contri-2.png)

*One of the illustrations from Scriberia that was developed in November‚Äôs Book Dash*

We ran the third Book Dash event from 9 to 13 November completely online with 20 participants.
In the last newsletter, we highlighted the impressive work carried out by our attendees.
In this newsletter, we are happy to share the full report that can be read [here](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2020-report).

In the previous Book Dash events, illustrations by Scriberia artists had added enormously to the productivity, enthusiasm and outcome of the events.
We continued this tradition by inviting a Scriberia artist, Jem Milton, who spent 3 days during the Book Dash interacting with the participants and developing new sets of illustration for _The Turing Way_ community.
The artwork has been shared on Zenodo: <zenodo link> under CC-BY license and will be added in the book going forward.
You are welcome to share, reuse and distribute them by attributing "The Turing Way Community, & Scriberia. (2020, December 15). Illustrations from the Turing Way book dashes. Zenodo. <DOI>".

## Acknowledgements and celebrations

### Contributor in Focus: Esther Plomp

![Headshot of Dr Esther Plomp](images/2020-12-esther-focus-4.png)

[EstherPlomp](https://github.com/estherplomp) is a Data Steward at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, where she supports researchers with their data management and open science practices.
As a co-chair of the Research Data Alliance group [Physical Samples and Collections in the Research Data Ecosystem IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/physical-samples-and-collections-research-data-ecosystem-ig), she hopes to bring together specialists from my research field to establish guidelines for isotopic data from human remains and guidelines for how to handle and document physical samples.
She is a regular contributor of _The Turing Way_ ever since her participation in the Book Dash event in February 2020.

In her words:
> Thanks to the Turing Way I really learned how to work collaboratively using GitHub.
> The book dash was a great kick start to actually practise and directly apply these skills, which now allows me to contribute more confidently to other projects as well!
> I primarily contributed to the Reproducible Research Chapter, to the Research Data Management section. I reviewed existing content and I'm working on adding a section on Data Management Plans and how to handle personal data.
> I also made a [The Turing Way poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4263403) that I presented during a conference.
> I hope to pay it forward and facilitate others in learning how to work with GitHub through The Turing Way or Carpentry workshops.

## Highlights from 2020 & Happy New Year 2021

### 2020: Year in Review

As we complete the second year of _The Turing Way_, we review the year 2020 month-by-month to highlight some of the important milestones we have achieved in the project together with our community members.

* **January**: Translation efforts started with Chinese and Spanish translation of _The Turing Way_ chapters on [Transifex system](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/translation/translation_guide.md) set up and used by several community members.
* **February**: The third Book Dash took place in person in London on 11-12 February 2020. Conducted over 1.5 days, this event was attended by 15 new participants and 3 helpers. We also launched our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/turingway).
* **March**: As the world wide lockdown started due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created more ways to stay connected with our members by hosting coworking calls weekly and Collaboration Cafes twice every month.
* **April**: The community grew to 120 members and in addition to the Guide for Reproducible Research, _The Turing Way_ book was upgraded to include the guides for Project Design, Communication, Collaboration and Ethics.
* **May**: Collaboration between Open Life Science and _The Turing Way_ was formally established (OLS-2 for Turing) to offer mentorship to its community members in developing Open Science projects.
* **June**: The Turing Way members delivered several online workshops and participated in conferences relevant for Open Science, reproducibility and Data Science.
* **July**: The community Slack space was created to facilitate structured discussions online, which was not effective on Gitter. 12 members joined OLS-2 with 6 projects from Turing and _The Turing Way_.
* **August**: To allow a proper break for our community and team members amidst this busy year, we declared a break in the project August.
* **September**: The [community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook) started to expand by including chapters on concepts, practices and workflow used by the community members. Particularly, we shared a document detailing how we acknowledge everyone in _The Turing Way_. We also hosted a technical writer upon the successful selection of our Google Season of Doc application.
* **October**: We hosted the HacktoberFest and facilitated the translation of the READMEmd file in multiple languages. The first good first label was used to onboard members new to Open Source projects,
* **November**: Malvika and Kirstie hosted the fourth Book Dash event from 9-13 November and connected with 18 new members who worked collaboratively on the project and 2 core members who provided mentorship support. We also received the Turing online Training grant to continue our collaboration with the OLS mentoring program in 2021.
* **December**: We are ending the year with over 235 contributors, 500 subscribers of our monthly newsletters and 1500 followers on Twitter. So far they all have together developed 30 chapters, 134 subchapters and several supporting resources within our 5 guides and a community handbook.

### Thank you! & News year wishes

![A GIF with a statement 'Thank you very much' with the silhouette of snow and a calmly flowing river](images/2020-12-thank-you-7.gif)

We want to express our gratitude towards all of you - our community members. 
Thank you for collaborating on GitHub and contributing to _The Turing Way_ book by thoughtfully developing, reviewing and maintaining its chapters and infrastructure that are used by researchers globally. 
Your participation in the online Collaboration Caf√©s, coworking calls, Book Dash events and community discussions on Slack this year have made _The Turing Way_ even more, vibrant and welcoming for new members. 

2020 has not been an easy year for most and therefore it is even more important for us to acknowledge that we value your participation in the projects immensely. 
It is only by involving the diverse community of individuals from different backgrounds, domain knowledge, skill levels and experiences from all around the world, can we make ‚Äúreproducibility too easy not to do‚Äù.
We hope that you can take a break and enjoy the end of the year. We wish you a happy new year 2021!

Malvika, Kirstie and all the team! üíô
