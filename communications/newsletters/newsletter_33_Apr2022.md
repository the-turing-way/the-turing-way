# Upcoming Events

## Tune into our Fireside Chat 🔥

![Alt: Fireside chat image](images/2022-04-fireside.png)

**On 29 April 2022, 15:00-16:30 UTC ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2022-04-29/15:00)): the next Fireside Chat will take place on the topic: “Enabling Inclusive Conferencing in the 'Post-Pandemic Era'”.**
Over the past 2 and a half years, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a reckoning with how scientific research is done across international borders – and how scientific conferencing is done in turn.
Alongside the shift to “working from home”, conferences also moved online.
But as many events begin to move back to in-person events in the coming months and years, this Fireside Chat brings together diverse voices from different projects and communities to talk more about the role of conferences in scientific collaboration, and the trade-offs involved in this shift back to in-person conferences.

**Chaired by Anne Lee Steele and Lilly Winfree (Frictionless Data), this panel will feature insights from Dorothea Hug Peter (UseR), Elio Campitelli (MetaDocencia), Gilbert Beyamba (Pollicy), and Ben Krikler (RemotelyGreen).**
These individuals represent different communities with expertise and insights from organising and participating in international conferences.  
[Sign up on the Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fireside-chat-making-virtual-participation-a-global-default-tbc-tickets-318719758377).

## Opportunities in the Turing Orbit

### Introduction to Data Science and AI Training: Review and Illustration Sprint

⏰ Express your interest to attend the review sprint before **21 April 2022** via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/fXPZ9yPzMkqMxrdQ8).
🗓️ Program dates: Thursday, 28 and Friday, 29 April 2022 (1.5 days)

Lydia France, Federico Nanni and Malvika are developing training materials for data science for biomedical researchers: [Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience).
These materials cover a range of topics on data science and AI practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs, and mid to late-career biomedical scientists in two training modules.

They are hosting a review and illustration sprint on 28 and 29 April and inviting applications from external members to review, give feedback and improve these materials for their use.
Participants can choose to attend from **five 2-hour long sessions for a collaborative review** of these training materials.
They will also work with a professional scribe from [Scriberia](https://www.scriberia.com/) to help develop accessible illustrations to include in the materials.

### Upcoming event: Tools, Practices & Systems Programme Seminar

⏰ Registration link: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMtc-qtpzsqE9DB9M9x4_kpcnYN_e-bJP3d
🗓️ Wednesday 27 April 2022 | 12:30 - 14:00 BST (UTC+1)

**Join the Turing's Tools, Practices & Systems programme at their monthly seminar. This month, they'll be welcoming James Muldoon (author of Platform Socialism - Social Ownership in the Digital Economy).**

Tech companies have been criticised for their surveillance practices, privacy breaches and monopolistic ambitions.
Instead of inquiring as to how we could ‘fix’ Facebook, this paper explores alternatives that could replace them.
It presents the idea of platform socialism - the organisation of the digital economy through the social ownership of digital assets and democratic control over the infrastructure and systems that govern our digital lives.
This framework facilitates holistic thinking about the systemic nature of the problems we face and the need for genuine alternatives.
To develop the principles and institutional sketch of platform socialism, I draw inspiration from the writings of two early twentieth century writers: the libertarian socialist, G. D. H. Cole and the Austrian philosopher and economist Otto Neurath.
I propose new forms of participatory and decentralised governance through an ecosystem of alternative ownership models of digital platforms.
How would socially-owned and controlled apps operate in transport, food delivery and short-term accommodation? Drawing from historical examples and contemporary prototypes, platform socialism examines a variety of ways communities could reclaim ownership and control over digital platforms.

### Upcoming event: "The Practice of Digital Infrastructure"

![Alt:Code for Science & Society event](images/2022-04-css.png)

Join a celebration of the first cohort of the digital [infrastructure incubator at Code for Science & Society](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/) as they share out learnings from the past six months.
Teams open their project notebooks to discuss approaches to governance, community engagement, and the practice of building cultural infrastructure.
After lightning talks by project leads, we turn to the audience to further discuss the practices of building sustainably.
