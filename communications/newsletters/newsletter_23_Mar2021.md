*[Kirstie Whitaker tweeting](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1372105545646276611?s=20) to invite applications and joining Collaboration Cafes to clarify  questions.*

Applications for the upcoming Book Dash can be submitted until **15 April 2021** by responding to [this online form](https://forms.gle/nDd5KzQaXQrkZ6Hn8). A few points to note:
* It takes an average of 30 minutes to prepare an application. 
Therefore, we have provided a [template document](https://tinyurl.com/tw-bookdash-template) to help you work on your application draft locally before you submit it.
* **Successful participants will be provided with a budget** to pay for any accessibility and participation related requirements including subsistence cost. 
You can see details in this [report from the last Book Dash](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-nov20-report.md).

## News from the community

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 participation

_The Turing Way_ is accepting proposals from interested student developers (GSoC candidates) to write their application to work on the project.
You can find details on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1787) and [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/t/gsoc-2021-project-idea-15-1-the-turing-way-a-how-to-guide-to-data-science/18168/6).

### New chapters

**FAIR principles**: Thanks to Esther Plomp, Emma Karoune and Ismael Kherroubi-Garcia for writing and reviewing the [chapter on FAIR principles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html).

**Research Activism**: Laura Carter, Arielle Bennett-Lovell and Asha Titus co-wrote the first draft of the chapter [Activism in Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/activism.html), and they invite you to contribute by adding case studies and examples from your work.
