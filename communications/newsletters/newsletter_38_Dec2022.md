## Ecosystem Leadership Award to Establish a Practitioners Hub

*The Turing Way* was granted the Ecosystem Leadership Award under the EPSRC Grant EP/X03870X/1 and The Alan Turing Institute to build ***The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub**.
This funding will enable our plans for advancing *The Turing Way*'s impact and expertise in embedding best practices into organisations across the broader data science and AI. 
This will be an active effort to build a bi-directional channel between *The Turing Way* and organisations that benefit from and contribute to the project.
This funding support a Research Project Manager and a Postdoctoral Research Associate, ensuring long-term sustainability strengthened through the Practitioners Hub.

*Read the full [proposal on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7427274).*

## OpenUK Award Under the 'Belonging' Category

We are so excited to share that *The Turing Way* won an **OpenUK award under the category of Belonging**.
The project was nominated by Malvika Sharan on behalf of the community to recognise the 3+ years of accumulated work in the project, thoughtfully facilitated by our community members.
Although *The Turing Way* book is written around best practices for open, reproducible and ethical data science, the 'process' of community engagement, respectful co-creation and relentless advocacy have always centred on EDIA (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility) principles.
This award is a recognition of those values embedded in the community-led work of *The Turing Way*! 
We thank you to creating a deep sense of belonging for everyone you have helped, supported and recognised in *The Turing Way* and the broader Open Science ecosystem.

![Alt: A designed flier for the OpenUK Award Winners 2022. There is a dark and star-filled background image, and two labels: "Category - Belonging" and "Sponsored by: Avanade". In the middle *The Turing Way* logo is depicted by a long road](images/2022-12-openuk-2.jpg)

### New Impact Report Highlighting *The Turing Way*

Many participatory projects at the Turing are leading the way for responsible research and innovation in data science.
*The Turing Way* community have always exemplified that, which is highlighted in the 'AI for Science and Government' impact report **Better Together: The people-centred approaches driving forward data ethics**.
The report discusses the various avenues where *The Turing Way* has played a key role.
We thank **Laura Ación, Chelle Gentemann and Chris Erdmann** for their contributions to this article highlighting how they champion *The Turing Way* in their organisations.

## Project Governance Updates

The third core team meeting was held on 7 December 2022.
Hosted by the Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele, members of the core organising team came together to share updates with each other.
As a part of the project's governance, representatives of **infrastructure maintenance, writers & reviewers, Mentors & Trainers and Translation & Localisation working groups** shared updates from their areas of work. 
During the trial phase, the members of different working groups are addressing issues crucial to the sustainability of the project while formalising their ways of working and identifying what ongoing support could look like for them. 
Each working group currently operates independently of other groups, while reporting their progress during the coworking calls on Monday.
Thanks to the working group representatives for sharing updates from their groups during the Community Share Outs on 18 November. 

*Documentation (in progress) is shared in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/alanim-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2646).*

As we complete the fourth year of *The Turing Way*, we review the year 2022 month-by-month to highlight some of the important milestones we have achieved in the project together with our community members.

* **January**: We began the year by **formally establishing support and maintenance roles** of the Turing's Tools, Practices and Systems staff members in *The Turing Way* as the project's core team. See the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) document.
* **February**: The first Fireside Chat of 2022 was co-hosted with the Talarify co-founder Anelda Van der Walt on the topic [Gaps and Opportunities for Inclusive Multilingual Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydogg2tQljA&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl&index=3), which among many global initiatives highlighted the hard and important **work led by *The Turing Way* Localisation and Translation team**.
* **March**: We **welcomed Anne Lee Steele** as our new community manager. We collaborated with **Open Post Academics** to host a Fireside Chat on Emergent Roles in Research Infrastructure and Technology as well as invited review and feedback on two training materials developed on *The Turing Way*. Details in [March's newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/introducing-the-next-fireside-chat-book-dash-collaborative-projects-and-our-community-manager).
* **April**: We were **featured in the UK's Goldacre Review**, co-hosted another Fireside Chat with **MetaDocencia** on inclusive conferencing, formally included Translation & Localisation leads to the core team and ran workshops at AI-UK and Collaborations Workshop 2022. Details in [April's newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/new-chapters-sign-up-for-book-dash-the-upcoming-fireside-chat-and-many-other-community-updates). 
* **May**: We hosted the **7th Book Dash**, and piloted local hubs in Amsterdam, Bristol and London; [joined Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway); got featured in articles by JISC [profiling our project](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/membership/stories/the-turing-way-forward) and HiddenRef for getting ['Highly Commended' under the 'Practices' category](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/news-and-press-releases/progress-science-depends-a-team).

## Thank you & End of the Year Wishes!

2022 was another massive year of learning, expansion and far-reaching recognition.
Although embedding sustainability and formalising governance were some of our main focuses this year, we witnessed so much more in the community -- as highlighted earlier in the 'non-exhaustive' list of accomplishments!
We are constantly humbled by your inspiring work in *The Turing Way* and excited to have reached new milestones in the project together.

Stars and pieces of snow surround the Happy Holidays" phrase, with *The Turing Way* logo in the top right corner of the sketch](images/2022-12-holidays-7.jpg)

*Thanks to Esther Plomp for designing this beautiful graphic to wish you "Happy holidays" from *The Turing Way* core team!*

We thank you for your genuine support, continued collaborations and sustained engagement with *The Turing Way*.
We hope that you can take a break and enjoy the end of the year.

We wish you a happy new year! See you in 2023.

Malvika, Anne and Kirstie on behalf of *The Turing Way* Project Members. 💜
