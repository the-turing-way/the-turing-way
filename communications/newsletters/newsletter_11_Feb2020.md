Attend our next Collaboration Cafe on 19 February 2020, at 19:00 GMT ([your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-02-19/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)).
Thanks to our friends, Naomi Penfold and Stafanie Butland, for mentioning this co-working event on their blog post - [Online Co-working Partnerships are Community of Practice in Action](https://www.cscce.org/2020/02/04/online-co-working-partnerships-are-community-of-practice-in-action/#more-3009).

Shout out to [Ang Li](https://twitter.com/abc782544421) and Yini He for translating 4 chapters of *The Turing Way* into Chinese.
Thanks to [Tony Yang](https://twitter.com/tony_yzy) who is establishing a system within the project to facilitate an effective translation process in Chinese.
They invite more members from the community to join them in their effort by translating *The Turing Way* in Chinese or other languages.

We are delighted to announce that we will be welcoming 15 of members at the book dash on 20 and 21 February, and _The Turing Way_ team are looking for a community member to give a short workshop at NeuroDoWo in Cologne, Germany in August.

## Community meetings

### Collaboration Cafes

Join us at the next collaboration cafe on 19 February at 19:00 GMT ([your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2020-02-19/19:00/TuringWay-CollaborationCafe)).
Sign up on [this HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe).

These online meetings are held using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to co-work without distractions to add your contributions to *The Turing Way* project.
These contributions can be from fixing bugs to reviewing existing chapters or adding your own content to the book.
*The Turing Way* team members will be present to help you troubleshoot and answer your questions.

Thanks to the positive response from our past attendees, we will continue to hold these working hours on the first Wednesday at 15:00 GMT and third Wednesday at 19:00 GMT of each month.
You can see the exact date and time for the next few sessions on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md).

Those who are not located in London have also received travel and accommodation support from *The Turing Way* project.
We are looking forward to welcoming them and working with them in person!

#### Your comments are needed on the rubric for selection

An open call for applications was opened in December 2019 for the book dash, inviting ideas from the interested candidates for their contributions to *The Turing Way* project.
They were also asked to justify how they will benefit from their participation at this event.
We adapted the Mozilla Open Leadership selection rubric for ranking and scoring all the applications.
This rubric is currently available in [pull request #804](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/804).
We welcome your comments and suggestions on this rubric for the selection process in our future events.

### Translating *The Turing Way* into additional languages

[Ang Li](https://twitter.com/abc782544421) and Yini He have translated four initial chapters of *The Turing Way* in Chinese. 
These researchers from China are spending a year in The Alan Turing Institute in the [Whitaker Lab](https://twitter.com/Whitaker_Lab) and are working on different topics in the neurobiology field while contributing to *The Turing Way* project.

*Read the [full thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1225719523497697280)*

[Tony Yang](https://twitter.com/tony_yzy), who is conducting his PhD research at Imperial College London, has set out to develop standardised guidelines and infrastructure for translation efforts in Chinese and other languages within the community.
He will be working with _The Turing Way_ team members during the book dash in integrating this workflow in the main project pipeline.

A past book dash attendee, [Camila Rangel-Smith](https://twitter.com/CamilaRangelS) and her colleague [Reina Camacho Toro](https://twitter.com/rcamachotoro) have expressed interest in beginning to translate a few existing chapters in Spanish.

We are so grateful for their work so far and invite our Chinese- and Spanish-speaking members to join this effort.
Join the discussion [on this GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/767).

## Tips & Tricks for new contributors

Wondering how getting involved with this community influences our contributors?
Our core contributors share their experiences as "impact statements".

This month we want to highlight the impact statements by [Louise Bowler](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/impact_statements/louise-bowler.md) and [Sarah Gibson](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/impact_statements/sarah-gibson.md).

Louise started to contribute to this project as part of the Turing's Reproducible Research Champions programme.
She worked on improving the reproducibility of recent papers written by Turing researchers, a write-up for which will appear at the end of the relevant chapters, with links to the code and guidance on how to set up and use the projects.

> "*The Turing Way* is the first large-scale open source project that I've been part of, and I found it a very positive experience.
The enthusiasm we were met with each time we presented the project has definitely encouraged me towards adopting more open working practices in the future." - **Louise Bowler**

Sarah started by providing technical support to the project for reproducible computational environments and the Champions project by using [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

> "By being a visible member of the team at a range of research-based events, I have been able to champion reproducibility, *The Turing Way* and Binder projects throughout the research community and disseminate the lessons I've learned through the workshops I've presented." - **Sarah Gibson**

***We would love to hear from you!***

*If you are able to share your impact story, please get in touch or send a [pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls) for your impact statement to be included [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/project_management/impact_statements).*

## Requests for your help

### NeuroDoWo

[NeuroDoWo](https://neurodowo.nwg-info.de/) - the Neurobiology Doctoral Students Workshop - is an annual, student-organized meeting covering a wide range of topics and with a vision to educate and empower fellow young researchers.
This years meeting is organized in Cologne, Germany and will take place from the 19 to 21 August.

Anna-Maria Jürgensen, on behalf of the organising team, has asked if a member of _The Turing Way_ community could lead a short workshop on the relevance, challenges and opportunities of open and reproducible research.

Kirstie has given lots of talks about _The Turing Way_ and her goal for 2020 is to have twice as many *other* people give talks about the project than herself.
This is a really great opportunity for any community member who has contributed to the project to get some 1:1 coaching with Kirstie, practice their presentation skills (reusing slides or making their own), travel to Cologne, and meet and influence the next generation of world leading researchers.

There is funding available to support travel and accommodation at the event and you do not need to work in the field of neuroscience to give this talk.

Please reply to [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com) before 2 March if you would like to discuss giving this presentation and leading the discussion.
Thank you in advance for helping grow and promote our community 🙏 ✨
