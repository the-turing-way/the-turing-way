### Preparation to Make a New Release on Zenodo

We are preparing to publish a new release of *The Turing Way* book with the complete GitHub repository on Zenodo.
One of the most exciting and challenging parts of this process will be to create a list of co-authors out of 241 listed contributors.
We will be closely following the process as described in the [Acknowledgement](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement.html) chapter.
Please add your profile and personal highlights to our [Contributors Record](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html), if you have not yet done that already.
This will allow us to acknowledge your work and include ORCID identifier for co-authors when publishing on Zenodo.
Since this will be a major release, we invite your help and welcome any feedback to enhance the workflow for making new releases.
Please use [issue #1751](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1751) to share your thoughts and ideas.

### An Emerging Technology Charter for London References *The Turing Way*

*The Turing Way* was listed as one of the selected references in the Charter draft developed to guide emerging technology in London. 
The Mayor of London had tasked the Chief Digital Officer for London and the Smart London Board to develop this Charter which is based on three key principles to guide discussions between makers and buyers, (1) Establish common, open and trusted ways of working between innovators, public services and Londoners when trialling and deploying new technologies, (2) Respect equality, diversity and human rights and act lawfully in the design and use of emerging technology, (3) Collect, manage, use and share data legally, ethically and securely.
*The Turing Way* was referenced in the recommendations for principle 1:
> When designing, developing, trialling and deploying emerging technologies, we aspire to work in the open wherever we can, sharing our plans and experience, working collaboratively with other organisations and reusing good practice.
> Use of open, robust and reproducible approaches and standards, as illustrated, for example, by *The Turing Way* community materials.

![Note that data can be partially the same and partially different at the same time (say, half the same, and half different). Strictly speaking, in such cases, the difference ‚Äúabsorbs‚Äù the classification, leaving the data simply ‚Äúpartially different.‚Äù The same can be said about the analysis: if only some procedures are selected, and part of these are different, it is a partially different analysis. Hence, a revised version of The Turing Way definition can be summarized in Table 2.](images/2021-02-scigen-repro-def-5.png)
