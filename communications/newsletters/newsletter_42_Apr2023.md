### Festival of Hidden REF (Thursday 21 September 2023), Bristol, UK

On 21st September 2023, the “Festival of Hidden REF” will bring together communities of vital-but-unrecognised roles alongside policymakers to work on building a more effective and fairer system of evaluating success in research.
 
Please see the blog post below for more information

### Blog post: Can National Research and Education Networks be a focal point for Research Software Engineers in some regions?

[Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal](https://saranjeetkaur.github.io/About-Me/) explores thoughts on the potential role of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in promoting the growth of a Research Software Engineering (RSE) community in Asia-Pacific. The significance of this lies in the fact that NRENs have not traditionally been significantly involved in supporting RSE groups in other regions.

### How should an Open Research Infrastructure organisation spend USD 130,000? 

[Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org/) (IOI) have started a collective funding pilot last year with the goal to experiment with and learn from building a more collective, open and transparent funding process, in which they serve real community needs through centring the voices of those who are most impacted by/under-represented in funding decision-making.

They are now running a **15-min design survey** and would love to invite you and those in your networks to help inform how this funding will be distributed. You can also express interest in joining the advisory panels for the funding calls we aim to launch in mid-May.
