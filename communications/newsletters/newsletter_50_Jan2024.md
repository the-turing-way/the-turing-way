# Community News and Updates

![Alt: A handrawn image by Scriberia artist of a garden. "Thanks for Contributing to the Turing Way" is written at the top in scripted text in green and black. The image is drawn in shades of green, grey, and black: in a cartoon-like style. The garden contacts a toolshed in the far corner, with bushes that contain pie charts. There is a pond that contains ones and zeroes, like binary code. The phrase "thanks" is drawn on a flower label, that is stuck into a flower pot that has leafy green roots coming out of the pot.](https://i.imgur.com/AJgGmCn.jpg)

## Join us at new monthly calls

This year, we are introducing two new sets of calls: Community Calls for sharing governance and project updates, and Onboarding Calls for new members ensuring  they have an opportunity to get a warm welcome to our community.

### Save the Date for our Community Call

On 15 February from 3:00 to 4:30 pm London time ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2024-02-15/15:00)), we will host our first Community Call to engage members of our community in governance discussions.

This new set of bi-monthly calls will provide an open forum for sharing project updates, discussing governance-related work and inviting feedback and involvement from our community. 
By opening up these discussions to everyone, our aim is to foster transparency and improve our decision-making process within *The Turing Way*. 
These calls will also serve as an opportunity to explore and exchange insights about various projects, Working Groups, and sub-communities that have taken root within *The Turing Way*, both formally established and organically emerged.

***To receive the joining link, [please register here](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwud-6srjoiE9bicyWMkAoOI57enHO9bnwE#/registration).***

### Onboarding Calls

We successfully hosted our first onboarding call of 2024 on January 31. 
These calls are hosted every two months, where we will meet new members and create a space for them to connect with our community and available resources, ensuring they have the support they need to navigate and kickstart their journey with *The Turing Way*. 
These calls create an open space for questions, discussions, and a warm welcome for you into our community.

[Sign up for our next call](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcscO6vpjIrGdKaQ_LeSBYr4XVZpMYmEjho#/registration) on 27 March at 15:00 London time ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2024-02-27/15:00))

## Community News

## Read our November Book Dash report

Thank you to the November 2023 Book Dash Committee for planning a success event this past November! 

The November 2023 Book Dash report is now online. We are grateful for the work of Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp, Sarajeet Kaur, Liz Hare, Winny  Nekesa and Susana Roman Garcia – all members of the Book Dash Planning Committee alongside Alex and Anne.
This is the first time we have completed and release this report collaboratively, and we're grateful for the time and care it took to prepare.

You can now read the November report on our [Github repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/book-dash/2023-Nov-BookDash-10.md).

While we are still processing the images from this Book Dash, here are a few images from Scriberia below:

![Alt: Three hand-drawn images from scriberia. They have a light green, dark green, orange, and muted blue color scheme](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByHYyLGiT.jpg)
The first image has a leaf that is split into four panels, representing a virtual call. The second image features two pairs of rowers in a river of data, one synchronised because they are rowing in the same direction, the other not synchronised as they are not. The final shows a bunch of folks standing nex tto a tree trunk that is splitting off into different branches that make it look like a book.

## Join the discussion on changes on our infrastructure

As you know, *The Turing Way* now has its own Github organisation, which was a massive piece of work led by the Infrastructure Working Group.
They are now managing the distribution of different kinds of resources from our main repository to several specific community-maintained repositories.
This will allow repositories to be more manageable, such as by specific Working Groups and easier to navigate for new members.

We would like to invite you to join the discussion in the issue [#3352](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3352). 

Please join the #infrastructure channel on slack for more information as well.

## Moving to a Permanent Domain Name

Since its launch, *The Turing Way* has utilised [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host our book online at [the-turing-way.netlify.app](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html). 
We have been discussing the possibility of switching hosting platforms in the near future. 
However, to minimise the impact on our readers and user community, we have decided to 'finally' purchase our own domain name (so you don't need to worry about the backend!).

While this may sound like trivial news, we value your choices and opinions in making this permanent change.
Please participate in the voting and discussion under the issue [#3266](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3266).

### Some Shout Outs from FOSDEM

![Alt: Picture on left has Jim Madge, a tall man wearing a green sweater, is standing in front of a university classroom. The screen says: "Bridging contributor's knowledge and the technology of The Turing Way, an open guide for data science". Picture on the right has Mike Nolan (dark beard with button down shirt) and Stephen Jacobs (multicolored shift with guitars and glasses) standing in front of a lecture room that has many chalk boards. One has 'Community DevRoom '24' written on it. The slides, which hang high above the boards read 'Our epistemology' which lists The Turing Way as an influence.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJwMBDboT.png)

Jim Madge gave a presentation on Saturday, 4 February representing the Infrastructure Working Group in his talk in the Open Research devroom: [Briding Contributor's Knowledge and the Technology of The Turing Way, an Open Guide for Data Science](https://jimmadge.github.io/fosdem24/). Watch the video on the [FOSDEM 2024 website](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2928-bridging-contributor-s-knowledge-and-the-technology-of-the-turing-way-an-open-guide-for-data-science/).

This year, Anne (me!), joined the organising team of [Open Research Room Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/open-research/), having given a talk about *The Turing Way* at FOSDEM 2023.
The organising team and the speakers included some of our current and previous contributors ([details](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/open-research/)).

In the Community Devroom, Mike Nolan and Stephen Jacob featured *The Turing Way* in their talk sharing about OpenRIT's fellowship program that draws lessons from existing projects including *The Turing Way* and OLS (Open Life Science), both of which have their roots in the Mozilla Open Leadership program. 

![Alt: Anne is wearing a bright blue shirt with both her hands up, standing at the front of a crowded classroom, with a few computers on a stand in front of her. A large screen in front of the room says "Bridging Research and Open Source" on a pair of slides. One audience member has their hands up.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkSSOI-jT.jpg)
