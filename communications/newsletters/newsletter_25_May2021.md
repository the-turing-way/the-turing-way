### Getting Started with *The Turing Way*

 *The Turing Way* offers multiple ways to get involved or use the project.
Although this is useful for many people who want to choose different pathways to enter and contribute to the project, it can be confusing for some people who don‚Äôt know where to start.
To address this, we host onboarding calls every Friday from 15:00 - 16:00 London time ([see in your time](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/14)).
Come along with your coffee and questions to these calls and our core contributors will help you get started with *The Turing Way*.

### Community calls for Co-Working and Discussion 

This month‚Äôs Collaboration Cafes are taking place on 02 June and 16 June 2021 from 15:00 - 17:00 London Time ([see in your time](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/14)).
