### Getting Started with *The Turing Way*

 *The Turing Way* offers multiple ways to get involved or use the project.
Although this is useful for many people who want to choose different pathways to enter and contribute to the project, it can be confusing for some people who don’t know where to start.
To address this, we host onboarding calls every Friday from 15:00 - 16:00 London time ([see in your time](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/14)).
Come along with your coffee and questions to these calls and our core contributors will help you get started with *The Turing Way*.

### Community calls for Co-Working and Discussion 

This month’s Collaboration Cafes are taking place on 02 June and 16 June 2021 from 15:00 - 17:00 London Time ([see in your time](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/14)).

### Book Dash May 2021 Reports and Resources

From 17 to 21 May 2021, we hosted our fifth Book Dash event. 
During this week, we hosted 13 development sessions, four open discussion sessions and a show and tell social call. On 21 May, the last day of the event, we also hosted two Community Share-outs to celebrate the work of our contributors, which was opened to the public. 
This event was attended by 20 participants who collaborated on [39 Pull Requests (PRs) and 31 issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls?q=label%3A0-book-dash-may21+) covering various topics and chapters across the five guides in the book.
We share more about our attendees and their contributions to the project below.

### Book Dash Planning Committee

This event could not have happened without the valuable work of our Planning Committee members: Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Brigitta Sipőcz, Carlos Martinez-Ortiz, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp and Laura Carter. These members had attended previous Book Dash events and had sent their applications expressing their interests to mentor new contributors. They provided useful input during the planning, mentored new contributors, hosted the development during the Book Dash week and led and discussion sessions.
Malvika Sharan and Kirstie Whitaker were involved to ensure that resources required for committee members to lead sessions and run this event were in place. 

### Resources from the Book Dash May 2021

Our Book Dash attendees worked on multiple chapters and project ideas that we have summarised below:

* Overview of new chapters:
  * “[Legal Disclaimer](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/legal-disclaimer.html)” by Laura Carter explaining where can readers find legal advice so that they do not consider any part of *The Turing Way* book as a legal guide. 
  * Malvika and Esther reorganised a chapter “[Making Research Objects Citable](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/citable.html#)”,  previously listed under the Guide for Reproducible Research.
  * Kirstie Whitaker wrote a chapter on “[Barriers to Reproducibility](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers.html)” describing what challenges researchers face in their research when planning to apply practices for reproducibility.
  * Batool and Brigitta collaborated on the chapters and illustrations for the [Continuous Integration chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci.html) that they started working on during the previous Book Dash event.
  * Arielle Bennett updated the chapter “[Activism for Researchers](https://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/activism.html)” with the contributions of Bruno Camino.
