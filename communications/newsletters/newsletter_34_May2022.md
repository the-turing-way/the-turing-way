_Book Dashers at the London, Amsterdam, and Bristol hubs! Pictured (left to right): Arielle Bennett, Laura Carter, Carlos Martinez, Lena Karvovskaya, Esther Plomp, Elisa Rodenburg, and Achintya Rao._

This book dash, we have been piloting a hub-format in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and both London and Bristol in the UK.
It has been an experiment in organising hybrid events across timezones, and we are interested in learning more about how we can support hybrid events to ensure enclusive participation in events like Book Dashes for our amazing community.  

The London hub is being hosted at the Alan Turing Institute.
Thank you to Lena Karvovskaya, who is hosting the Amsterdam hub at the Vrije Universiteit and to John Newby for hosting the Bristol hub at the Jean Golding Institute, University of Bristol.

_Emma Karoune, featured in The HiddenREF project representing The Turing Way!_

*The Turing Way* was recently awarded as a 'highly commended' project in The Hidden REF competition, which highlights non-traditional contributions to research.
Emma Karoune, core team member of The Turing Way was invited to give a short interview about the project, and you can [read the feature here](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/news-and-press-releases/progress-science-depends-a-team?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bnd_HiddenRefBlog_existing_20220426).
See the list of incredible winners for each category on the [HiddenREF website](https://hidden-ref.org/).
Thank you for representing our community, Emma!

## *The Turing Way* is in the Fediverse!

![Alt: Screenshot of mastodon profile](images/2022-05-mastodon-screenshot.jpg)
_The Fediverse is a common name for federated social networks that run on free/open software on a number of different servers across the world. [Source](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/)_

Thank you to Danny Garcide for creating a profile on a Mastodon instance (called Fosstodon - dedicated to Free & Open Source Software) for *The Turing Way*.
Mastodon is similar to Twitter, but is both open source and decentralised.
Learn more about [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway) here, and follow us at: https://fosstodon.org/@turingway.

For now, we've set up our profile to mirror our Twitter activity (with the help of the open source tool: http://moa.party) and we're working out how we want to manage it going forwards.
If you have ideas, let us know!

## *The Turing Way* Forward Featured on JISC

A new section has been added to the Community Handbook on [Fireside Chats](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html?highlight=fireside%20chat).
We hope this section will be useful for others planning similar events, and apply lessons we have learned along the way.

In the future, we'd like to add more information about each Fireside chat hosted so far, to ensure that these conversations can live beyond the events themselves. We hope that they can provide ideas for best practices and shared experiences for others interested in similar topics.

If you'd like to get involved in that process, join the [Issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2344) on Github.
