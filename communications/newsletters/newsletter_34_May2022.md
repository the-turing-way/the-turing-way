# Upcoming Events

## Community Share-Out on 20 May

On 20 May 2022, the last day of Book Dash, we will host two [Community Share-Out and Contributor Celebrations Events](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-events.html#community-share-outs-contributor-celebration).
This is a public event for folks interested in learning more about _The Turing Way_, seeing what recent updates have been made in the project and celebrating the incredible work of our contributors.
At the Community Share-Out, we will also release the new version of _The Turing Way_ book and give an early preview of a new set of illustrations developed during the Book Dash.
Sign up to attend one or both sessions on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-community-share-out-and-contributor-celebrations-may-2022-tickets-323373307267).

![Alt: Image of London, Amsterdam, and Bristol hubs for the Book Dash event](images/2022-05-bookdash-hubs.jpg)
_Book Dashers at the London, Amsterdam, and Bristol hubs! Pictured (left to right): Arielle Bennett, Laura Carter, Carlos Martinez, Lena Karvovskaya, Esther Plomp, Elisa Rodenburg, and Achintya Rao._

This book dash, we have been piloting a hub-format in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and both London and Bristol in the UK.
It has been an experiment in organising hybrid events across timezones, and we are interested in learning more about how we can support hybrid events to ensure enclusive participation in events like Book Dashes for our amazing community.  

The London hub is being hosted at the Alan Turing Institute.
Thank you to Lena Karvovskaya, who is hosting the Amsterdam hub at the Vrije Universiteit and to John Newby for hosting the Bristol hub at the Jean Golding Institute, University of Bristol.

_The Fediverse is a common name for federated social networks that run on free/open software on a number of different servers across the world. [Source](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/)_

Thank you to Danny Garcide for creating a profile on a Mastodon instance (called Fosstodon - dedicated to Free & Open Source Software) for *The Turing Way*.
Mastodon is similar to Twitter, but is both open source and decentralised.
Learn more about [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway) here, and follow us at: https://fosstodon.org/@turingway.

For now, we've set up our profile to mirror our Twitter activity (with the help of the open source tool: http://moa.party) and we're working out how we want to manage it going forwards.
If you have ideas, let us know!

A new section has been added to the Community Handbook on [Fireside Chats](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html?highlight=fireside%20chat).
We hope this section will be useful for others planning similar events, and apply lessons we have learned along the way.

In the future, we'd like to add more information about each Fireside chat hosted so far, to ensure that these conversations can live beyond the events themselves. We hope that they can provide ideas for best practices and shared experiences for others interested in similar topics.

If you'd like to get involved in that process, join the [Issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2344) on Github.
