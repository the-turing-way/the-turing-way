## Community Events

Community calls are key for _The Turing Way_ community: they're where folks learn about each others' work, collaborate on ideas, and get inspired.

### Book Dash, Community Share-outs, and GitHub Training Session üìöüí®

**The 8th annual Book Dash will be happening from 14-18 November.** We're excited to welcome newcomers and returnees for a week of collaboration and coworking! [Book Dashes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) are an important space where our community comes together to write chapters in _The Turing Way_, work on new projects, do focused work, and learn from each other. 
While most of our working sessions will take place online, we will continue to pilot a hybrid and hub model next week!

*While Book Dash will be attended by invited participants, we will be hosting several public events listed below.*

### GitHub Training Session 

On **9 November** at 17-18 UTC/UK time ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/london/2022-11-09/17:00)), _The Turing Way_ team members will host a training session for members new to GitHub. 
Sign up on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-github-training-session-tickets-460659875087) to attend.

### Data Conversations: Innovation in Research

This month, VU Amsterdam's Research Data Management (RDM) Community Manager and a Book Dash committee member is hosting a Data Conversation during Book Dash week.

On **15 November** at 14-15:30 UTC/UK time, this Data Conversation will feature Leighann Kimble (VU Amsterdam) and Maxine Mackintosh (Genomics England) sharing lessons learned about reproducibility in medical research and data sharing.

### 2021-2022 Fireside Chats 

![Alt: A collage features pictures of 49 participants (cut out in circles). There is picture of burning woodlog against a grey background, with white box featuring logos of co-organising organisation.](images/2022-nov-2.jpg)

*49 diverse members from over 10 communities co-organised the Fireside Chats in 2021-2022.*

**The first round of the Fireside Chat series concluded last month!** This [series was started](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html) to bring together diverse perspectives and catalyse cross-community collaborations across community-oriented projects in the open science ecosystem.

Beginning with our inaugural Fireside Chat about ["What is _The Turing Way_?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k) featuring co-leads Kirstie Whitaker and Malvika Sharan with Cassandra D. Gould van Praag, these conversations have focused on all sorts of topics related to open science: from open hardware to citizen science, open infrastructure to translation and localisation, to community building and sustainability more broadly. 

Thank you so much for tuning in, co-organising, co-designing, and for being a part of these Fireside Chats with us. 
All recordings are available on this [Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl).

Watch a few recent recordings from recent months:
* **October**: Supporting citizen and participatory science communities ([video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ufANMIDxo&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl&index=9))
* **September**: Connecting open hardware to open science ([video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaPydydUcOc&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl&index=10&t=6s))

## Chapters and Collaborations in Progress

### New Chapters

A bunch of new chapters have been added to _The Turing Way_ over the past few months, related to a wide variety of ongoing and emergent topics across data science and open research. 
Congratulations to the writers and reviewers that made it happen!

* **[Research Infrastructure Developers Summary](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/research-infrastructure-developer.html)**: Owain Kenway recently added a summary of the Research Infrastructure Developers' role to the Research Infrastructure Roles subchapter. 
Owain leads a team of RIDs at UCL - so far the only institution to host them. 
We're excited to codify this emergent role within _The Turing Way_. 
* **[Machine Learning Model Licences](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml.html )**: **Jennifer Ding** and **Carlos Mu√±oz Ferrandis** collaborated to write a sub-chapter on [machine learning model licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml.html) which includes a case study based on concerns raised through the license selection process during BigScience 
Thank you to Arron Lacey, Sophia Batchelor, and Anne Lee Steele for reviewing. 
* **[Personal Story for RSE Asia](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/rse-personal-story.html)**: Saranjeet Kaur added her personal story as an RSE to the Research Infrastructure Roles sub-chapter. 
Thank you to Kim Martin, Esther Plomp, and Malvika Sharan for reviewing.
* **Sensitive Data**: Over the number of few years, an extensive set of subchapters has emerged around sensitive data. 
There are three sections: [about sensitive data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdp.html), [managing a sensitive data project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpm.html), and [working on sensitive data projects](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpw.html). 
Congratulations to Emma Karoune, Maria Eriksson and many others for co-authoring a new chapter on project design!
* **[Ethical Considerations when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance.html)**: Arielle Bennett added a speedblog co-written with Yo Yehudi, Gemma Turon, Declan Bays, Sarah Gibson, Stephan Druskat, Yadira Sanchez and Sophia Batchelor at Collaborations Workshop. 
This new sub-chapter is in the Guide for Ethical Research.
* **[Data Papers](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/dif-articles/data.html?highlight=data%20papers)**: Emma Karoune and Vicky Hellon co-wrote an article about Data Papers: describing both what they are and how to write them, available under the Publishing Different Article Types subchapter. 
* **[Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review.html )**: Lena Karvovskaya added a new chapter related to peer review, making explicit a process that many researchers tend to learn through informal methods. 
You can find it in the Guide for Communication.

### Infrastructure and Maintenance Updates

Maintaining a massive repository like *The Turing Way* takes a lot of digital caretaking ü§ó‚ú®

Danny Garside, a project maintainer, recently updated our version of JupyterBook and has been compiling and working on bugs within the project, as documented in this [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2611). 
Thank you so much for your caretaking and maintenance work of *The Turing Way*, Danny!

Alden Conner, a core team member, recently refreshed and standardised our promotion pack. Together with Sarah Gibson, she has also been working to update the Issue templates. 
Learn more in this [project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/31). 
Thank you, Alden and Sarah, for making it easier to talk about and contribute to *The Turing Way*!

### Project Governance Updates

The second core team meeting was held on 7 September 2022.
Working Groups were initiated during this time, and are being trialled across the project. 
Ongoing documentation is in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2646) as well as done independently by each group: 
- Reviewers and Editors: The R&E team has been working to address stale issues within the project. 
Learn more in their [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2633).
- Mentors and Trainers: The M&T team have been working to archive historical talks and workshops within the project. 
Learn more in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2643). 
- Maintainers: An Infrastructure/Maintainers Working Group is beginning  beginning to formalise its efforts, as documented in this [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2690). 

These groups are currently closed to the wider community as we trial what support could look like for them. 
Thank you all for your hard work in supporting and maintaining *The Turing Way* project!
