![Alt: A collage features pictures of 49 participants (cut out in circles). There is picture of burning woodlog against a grey background, with white box featuring logos of co-organising organisation.](images/2022-nov-2.jpg)

*49 diverse members from over 10 communities co-organised the Fireside Chats in 2021-2022.*

**The first round of the Fireside Chat series concluded last month!** This [series was started](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html) to bring together diverse perspectives and catalyse cross-community collaborations across community-oriented projects in the open science ecosystem.

Beginning with our inaugural Fireside Chat about ["What is _The Turing Way_?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k) featuring co-leads Kirstie Whitaker and Malvika Sharan with Cassandra D. Gould van Praag, these conversations have focused on all sorts of topics related to open science: from open hardware to citizen science, open infrastructure to translation and localisation, to community building and sustainability more broadly. 

Thank you so much for tuning in, co-organising, co-designing, and for being a part of these Fireside Chats with us. 
All recordings are available on this [Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl).
