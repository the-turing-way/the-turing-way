# The Turing Way -  Book dash reports

Dear friends of the Turing Way,

It's been quiet here on our newsletter for a while because we've been so busy running book dashes!
These incredible events have exceeded our expectations and resulted in so many amazing new contributions to the book.
There's more information about them below, but first, an update on *where* you can contribute to *The Turing Way*.

## GitHub repository update

We announced in our last newsletter that we had split off the handbook in a separate GitHub repository.
We then realized that there wasn't a technical reason to do this, and that splitting the conversations across two locations was really confusing.
Thus, you can find everything at https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way.
(RIP `-book` repository!)
We've updated the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) but please let us know if you find any mistakes.
We're always interested to hear about the hurdles to contributing to *The Turing Way*.
Please check out the guidelines and let us know what you think!

## Book dashes 

We were busy organising and running two very succcessful book dashes in May. 
Our events in Manchester and London were great opportunities to grow the Turing Way community and we were really lucky to be joined by Matt, an illustrator from [scriberia](http://www.scriberia.co.uk), who captured our book dashes wonderfully:

The Turing Way team was joined by 26 enthusiastic participants that provided a wide range of contributions to the Turing Way handbook:
* Proofreading and editing of existing chapters.
* Further information added to existing chapters.
* Writing new chapters, for example on [Reproducible data analysis pipelines for machine learning](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/machine_learning/book/content/machine_learning/machine_learning.md), [Credit for reproducible research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/credit/credit.html), and [Outreach and Communicating Results to Others](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/561).
* Reviewed pull requests.
* Restructuring of the chapter sections.

Full reports on our book dashes including feedback from our participants are available on GitHub:
* [Manchester book dash report](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-mcr-report.md)
* [London book dash report](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/book-dash/book-dash-ldn-report.md)

The illustrations will be made available under a [CC-BY licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) soon.

Thank you again to our incredible book dash participants.
We could not build a useful resource without you.

## Spreading the word
### Talks and hackathons
The team has been spreading the word about the Turing Way project through various talks:

* Kirstie and Patricia were at the [inaugural meeting of the UK network of Open Research Working Groups](https://sites.google.com/view/ukoswg19) at Aston University, Birmingham on 11 April 2019. Patricia presented on the Turing Way and her slides can be found on zenodo (doi: [10.5281/zenodo.2634185](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2634185)).
* Kirstie gave a keynote on *The Turing Way* at the [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon on 8 and 9 May 2019. A recording of her talk is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE) and her slides can be found on zenodo (doi: [10.5281/zenodo.2669548](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669548)).
* Kirstie presented *The Turing Way* at the [Software Citation Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/software-citation-workshop-tickets-59519083180) hosted by the British Library, Software Sustainability Institute, and The Alan Turing Institute. Her slides can be found on zenodo (doi: [10.5281/zenodo.2783998](http://doi.org/10 .5281/zenodo.2783998)).
* Sarah Gibson attended the Microsoft Reactor Research Software Engineering Hackday and led a team on BinderHub that improved [our Zero to BinderHub instructions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/build-a-binderhub/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binderhub.md).

### Where to meet us in the next few weeks

* Kirstie Whitaker will present *The Turing Way* at [Future-proofing your research: Moving Towards Open & Reproducible Research](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/future-proofing-your-research-moving-towards-open-reproducible-research-tickets-60575376582?aff=eac2) at Lancaster University on 4 June 2019.
* Rosie Higman will present on the Turing Way at the [NOWAL Research Support meeting](https://www.nowal.ac.uk/research-support-open-research-exchange-experience-university-manchester) in Manchester on 13 June 2019.
* Kirstie will re-run a shortened version of our March ["Boost your reproducibilty with Binder" workshop](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) at [Carpentry Connect](https://www.software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme) in Manchester on 26 June 2019.
* Turing Way team member Anna Krystalli will run a ReproHack at [Carpentry Connect](https://www.software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme) in Manchester on 27 June 2019, a one day hackathon that will attempt to reproduce results in published papers.
* Rosie Higman and Patricia Herterich will present the Turing Way at [the 48th LIBER Annual Conference](https://liberconference.eu/schedule/) in Dublin on 26 June 2019.
* Sarah Gibson will re-run a shortened version of our March "Build a BinderHub" workshop at the [RSEConf 2019](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/) in Birmingham 17 - 19 September 2019.

Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your contributions!
