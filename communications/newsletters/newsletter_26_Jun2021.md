# Success Stories from Book Dash Collaborations, Videos from Past Events & More Community Updates

Hello Turing Way friends!

In June, amidst the pandemic and lockdowns, our incredible Book Dash contributors and reviewers continued to collaborate and work on their contributions over the last month.🙏

Thanks to them (you!):
- 🎊 we published 8 chapters (with 20 subchapters) across guides for communication, collaboration and ethical research! 
- 📹 we also published videos from the Community Share out events that include stories and ideas behind the illustrations we recently released on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3332807).

If you are wondering where to start, [email Malvika](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk) who would love to chat about your work and find the right starting point for you in _The Turing Way_.

Find more details on these topics (and more) below 👇

*Thanks to Emma Karoune for reviewing this month's newsletter.* 🌷

## News from the Community

A month after the Book Dash (May 2021), several of our participants have merged the first versions of their chapters into _The Turing Way_ guides.
We are really happy to share these chapters with you and invite you to read, review and share them in your network.

Behind the wall several monsters are depicting human rights violations and harmful elements of society that can breach laws and policy in the absence of this protective wall.](images/2021-06-humanrights.png)

### [Law, policy and human rights in ethics](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/law-policy.html)

This chapter is edited by Laura Carter and reviewed by Laura Acion and Ismael Kherroubi-Garcia.
She writes “Knowing the law, policy, and human rights that underpin research ethics will give you a deeper understanding of how to conduct ethical research. It can also help you to advocate for ethical work with colleagues and collaborators.”

### [Setting up a project repository](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo.html)

This is an extended draft of an earlier chapter that describes what key documents should be added to a project repository.
It now features examples from _The Turing Way_ repository and resources from the Open Life Science training program.
-  Thanks to Lotty Coupat for writing [a case study from the AutSpaces project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-roadmapping.html) that describes how to set a roadmap for your project. 
- Thanks to Andreea Avramescu, Helen Nicholls and Becki Green from the ‘Engage @ Turing ’ graduate programme for providing examples to [set up repositories for a software project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-advanced.html).

### [6 new chapters in the Guide for Communication](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication)

![Maria quote tweeting The Turing Way announcement of new chapters: “That feeling when a great set of chapters (including a couple you've been working on) is about to get published in an amazing and open resource”](images/2021-06-mariatweet.png)

*Tweet by [Maria Nanton](https://twitter.com/bynans1/status/1408568198002364429?s=20)*

Emma Karoune, Maria Nanton and Marta Mangiarulo began their collaboration at the Book Dash and ended up writing six chapters in the guide for communication that features personal stories from Veronika Cheplygina, Yanina Bellini, Emma Harris and Zoe Ingram.
These chapters are edited by the authors along with Malvika and Esther Plomp.

## Contributor in Focus: Marta Mangiarulo

![Picture of Marta. She is a white woman, with light brown hair. She is wearing a black sleeveless top and sunglasses. She is holding a red bottle with the soap solution and blowing soap bubbles]images/2021-06-marta.png)

[Marta Mangiarulo](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#marta-mangiarulo) is a Research Assistant and Teaching Fellow in Psychology at the University of Leicester. 
Her research interests involve probabilistic inference, social hypothesis testing, and reasoning biases. 
She is also passionate about science communication and research dissemination and interested in replicability, open science issues, and the interface between cognitive and social aspects in social psychology. As a two times Book Dash attendee, Marta reflects on her participation:
> In the **November 2020 book dash**, I used GitHub for the first time! I started familiarising myself with the GitHub environment and learned how to collaborate through it to provide valuable contributions to the project. 
> My work during this book dash had mostly been individual, but in the **May 2021 book dash**, I was very happy to start where I had left off. 
> I collaborated with others, made relevant contributions and I have a clear idea of where I would like to go next which is much more than what I was hoping for! 
> I loved taking part in the Book Dash, it is such a rewarding experience above and beyond its material outputs.

### Open Life Science Application Call is Open!

[Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) (OLS) is a **16-week mentoring and training program** that upskills researchers in open and reproducible research and empowers them to become open science ambassadors in their communities. 
We have opened a call for applications for the next cohort, OLS-4, which will take place from September 2021 to January 2022. The deadline to submit your application is **15 July 2021**. Visit https://openlifesci.org for details.
OLS has received the [Turing Online Training Grant](https://www.applieddatascience.qmul.ac.uk/news/3817/the-turing-online-training-call-funding-opportunity), to specifically train and mentor the Turing and The Turing Way members under the collaboration name **OLS for Turing** (see [promotion pack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTH0hdIN8EeWdH_v-_LW0Yiy5cLD9BeATLwvzBuUrlooFqZxJ_DIX7tIcA1H2WfXR3j3RJ34wgxnfzs/pub)). We will also offer microgrants to our participants to ensure that they can equitably participate in the program.
