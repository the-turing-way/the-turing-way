## News from the community

### README file available in multiple languages


![Screenshot of a tweet from The Turing Way Twitter account with a globe image](images/Tweet-readme-Oct2020.png)
*[The Turing Way](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1316750745228713984?s=20) announces the newly translated README files in Dutch, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese*

Thanks to our HackberFest contributors for translating and reviewing _The Turing Way_ README.md file in multiple languages.
The file has been translated in Dutch (by Esther Plomp and Stefan Janssen), Italian (by Angelo Varlotta and Luca Bertinetto), Spanish (by Camila Rangel-Smith, Reina Camacho Toro and Laura Acion) and Portuguese (by Romero Silva and Gustavo Becelli do Nacimento), which are available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/README-translated).
Translation in more languages including French, German, Indonesian and Turkish are ongoing with the help of different contributors (see [GitHub issue #1335](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1335)). 

### Tutorial on Jupyter Book with _The Turing Way_

Malvika Sharan, Martina Vilas and Sarah Gibson have put together a tutorial on Jupyter Book using chapters from _The Turing Way_.
This tutorial was developed and launched at the JupyterCon 2020, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-jupyterbook-with-turing-way) under a CC-BY 4.0 and MIT license.
Through a step-by-step guide in 7 modules, you will learn about the collaborative nature of both projects and create your own Jupyter Book using files and chapters from The Turing Way as examples.
Each module comes with a Jupyter Notebook ([notebooks](https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-jupyterbook-with-turing-way/blob/master/notebooks)) and an introductory video available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dmdo6oKg6o9V7Q_e7WSX-vu).
Please test this tutorial, and share your feedback with us so that we can improve and further develop this resource.

### Contributors record with collaborating organisations

Last month, we announced the publication of our Contributors Record online in the [Afterword section of _The Turing Way_](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html).
As described in our [acknowledgement chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement/acknowledgement-examples.html#organisational-support), we also want to use this document to highlight collaborative efforts made by our contributors with the help of their organisations.
Thanks to [Carlos Martinez Oritz](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#carlos-martinez-oritz) and [Mateusz Kuzak](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#mateusz-kuzak), we have added the first entry about the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) under the [Collaborating Organisation](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#collaborating-organisations) section.
If you have participated in _The Turing Way_ with the support of your organisation, we invite you to expand this section by adding relevant details.

## Contributor in focus: Paul Owoicho

We are delighted to introduce you to our Google Season of Doc (GSoD) intern, Paul Owoicho.
Paul has a BSc in Software Engineering from the American University of Nigeria, and an MSc in Data Science from the University of Glasgow. 
He will be working with us for the next few months in the role of a technical writer, providing editorial support in the project. 
Together with Neha Moppen, he is participating in Open Life science with a project to embed accessibility in _The Turing Way_ guide, where he will receive training and mentorship on Open Science and community skills ([project detail](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/)).


![Portrait image of Paul Owoicho](images/Paul-Oct2020.png)

In his words:
> The Turing Way is my first foray into open source and has been a fantastic learning experience. 
> Not only have I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for how GitHub works, but I am also learning to prioritise sustainability and empowerment in the work that I do. 
> Soon, I hope to begin a PhD that explores how conversational search can be made more effective with the use of clarifying questions
