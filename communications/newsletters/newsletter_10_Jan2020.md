![screenshot of twitter message describing two questions to apply to join The Turing Way Book Dash event](images/BookDash_TwitterScreenshot_Jan2020.png)

A _Turing Way_ Book Dash is an in-person collaborative event where you will work with others to add to and improve [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) book.

The event will start on the afternoon of 20 February 2020 with an introduction to the project, which will be followed by an official dinner.
The complete day of 21 February 2020 will be dedicated to the project content development.
Your contributions may include, but are not limited to: science communication - skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications, great examples and case studies of reproducible research, writing new chapters, editing the current chapters and updating how the book looks online (CSS, logos, layout etc).

### Looking for helpers for the Book Dash

If you've already attended a _Turing Way_ Book Dash ðŸ“šðŸ’¨ or Binder workshop events then you're elgible to apply to join us as one of our helpers.
Your role will be to support contributors and help them brainstorm how they can share their expertise with the community.

Please contact [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com) if you are available and able to join the _Turing Way_ team for these events.
**Funding is available to support travel, accomodation and childcare requirements.**
Please include a few sentences about why you're interested and able to help participants get the most out of the two days.

We will review emails on Wednesday 22 January and reply with our selection (in the case of having more than 2 people offer their support) on Monday 27 January.

## News from the community

### Looking for helpers to deliver Binder workshop

[The British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) is hosting a half-day [Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) workshop **in Cambridge on 31 January** from 13:30 to 17:00.
At this workshop, the trainers will discuss reproducible computing environments, with examples of others' projects in [myBinder.org](https://mybinder.org) to help you learn how to prepare a binder-ready project.
At the end of the workshop, you will be able to take some of your own content (in R, Jupyter notebook, or scripts that can be run in the terminal) and prepare it so that it can be used by others on [myBinder.org](https://mybinder.org).

Registrations are currently limited to British Antarctic Survey team members, but _The Turing Way_ team are **looking for two helpers** to support Kirstie Whitaker in delivering the workshop.
Please contact [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com) if you are available and able to join the _Turing Way_ team.
Please include a few sentences about why you're interested and able to help participants learn how to use myBinder.
**Funding is available to support day return travel for the workshop.**

We will review emails on Monday 20 January and reply with our selection (in the case of having more than 2 people offer their support) on Tuesday 21 January.

### Binder workshop hosted by PyData Cambridge

Another [Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) workshop will be hosted by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge on **29 January** at 19:00.
Sarah Gibson will be leading participants through the [Zero to Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder/workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder.md) code along demonstration.

### Librarians building momentum for reproducibility logistics program

Registration is open for a virtual half-day conference for librarians who are working in, or want to learn more about, supporting research reproducibility.
This event will take place on **January 28** at 9:00-3:00pm PST, 12:00-6:00pm EST. They are are running this conference completely online, through the videoconferencing tool Zoom.
You are free to participate in the conference from wherever you can connect to the Internet!
Check details on [their official website](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/librarians-reproducibility/).

### The Whole Tale open source platform for reproducible research

The [Whole Tale project](https://wholetale.org/)  is an NSF-funded initiative building a scalable, open source platform for reproducible research.
Whole Tale supports the creation, publication, and execution of _tales_ -- executable research artifacts that capture, data, code and the complete software environment required to reproduce computational results.
They along with Harvard Dataverse team have set up a platform to demonstrate _tales_ using the Whole Tale platform as a dataset-level external tool on the demo instance at [https://demo.dataverse.org](https://demo.dataverse.org).

Check out examples for two different use cases: 1) [Whole Tale as Dataverse External Tool](https://youtu.be/AoSpQ3A7poY), demonstrating how Whole Tale can be used to launch an RStudio (or other) environment for exploration of "replication datasets" that contain code.
2) [Registering data for analysis in Whole Tale](https://youtu.be/oWEcFpEUmrU), demonstrating how source datasets can be registered in Whole Tale for analysis using RStudio with automatic citation.
A [short document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ln4wUTsBZ1mP9qUGGwfkM6p8bpmPSBRAvAWOkz2U_L) further describes the integration and planned features for anyone interested.
