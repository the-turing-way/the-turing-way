*[Watch her video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDVrI1917hc) to learn more about Arya and her work with The Turing Way.*

🚀 Meet Arya, our standout Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023 intern hosted by the GSoC organization INCF!

Arya, a computer science undergrad from Kerala, India, worked with mentors Johanna Bayer and Malvika Sharan to enhance The Turing Way book's usability.

She improved a Python package previously developed in The Turing Way to update the User Interface and personalize the browsing experience based on user profiles. Under the 'pathway' feature, this package has been deployed and merged into the book. Read details in her [GSoC report](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/communications/GSoC-applications/GSoC-2023/2023-GSoC-Final-Report-arya.md).

Thanks, Arya, for your invaluable contributions! 👏

### Explore the new 'pathway' feature in The Turing Way book

With the growing number of chapters, we've leveled up your reading experience.

🌟 Dive into curated content with four pathways tailored for Early Career Researchers, Project Leaders, Research Software Engineers, and Software Citation - browsable under the [pathway feature](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html#different-pathways).

Thanks again to Arya's work, a [Python package](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/2021-07-ux-funding-turing.md) was refined and customized, integrating community feedback. Shoutout to Johanna, Malvika, and the infrastructure working group for supporting this work – now [merged into the book](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3277)!

🚧 Help us create more pathways for an even more effective Turing Way experience for you and your colleagues. Your input matters!

📘 From November 13 to 17, 2023, The Turing Way celebrated its 10th Book Dash, and it was nothing short of spectacular! Huge thanks to the 35 brilliant minds who joined forces, crafting 34 issues and 42 pull requests on a spectrum of topics – from data hazards to project management, data feminism, academic-industry collaborations, mental health, accessibility, and beyond.

We had an in-person hub in London, but this Book Dash extravaganza wasn't confined to a single space.
We had online sessions spanning multiple time zones throughout the week, with special addition for America/Australia friendly time zones.

Kudos to the outstanding individuals who made this event extra special with special Book Dash sessions:

🌟 Committee Champions: Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Johanna Bayer, and Saranjeet Kaur – hosting onboarding and GitHub training sessions.
🖋️ Creative Maestro: Jonny Heath, poet and creative writer, returned to host a Creative Writing workshop.
🌐 Show and Tell Facilitators: Kirstie Whitaker and Susana Roman Garcia led 'Show and Tell' Lunch sessions in English and Spanish, opening the door for more multi-lingual sessions in the future.
🎨 Illustrator: Calum from Scriberia brought ideas to life with beautiful illustrations (coming soon!).
🗣️ Social Discussion: Richard Acton delved into licensing, sparking a fascinating discussion with our attendees.

## NASA TOPS Panel and Launch of Open Science 101 Modules

The Turing Way co-lead Malvika Sharan attended the final community panel of [NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) in Washington DC on 14 and 15 November 2023. 🌐🛰️

Malvika also attended a meeting hosted by OSTP and NASA TOPS on [Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/), which was held at the White House Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) with the community panelists and leaders from various federal agencies in the USA.

This event marked the two years of advisory support Malvika provided to the NASA TOPS team with a group of [international open science experts](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Panels).
