### Suggest a Panellist for the SeptembRSE Diversity and Inclusion Panel

Malvika will be hosting a [SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.github.io/#/event/L1001) panel on **Missing narratives in discussions around diversity and inclusion in research**. 
The panel will take place on 28 September 2021 and outputs from the events will be shared openly in *The Turing Way*.
Thanks to Rowland Mosbergen for joining the organising team and adding really valuable elements to this panel proposal, and Jeremy Cohen for supporting the logistics. 
Please suggest a panellist by responding to this form before **8 September 2021**: [online Google form](https://forms.gle/A5u3wNx9JzcPfDsv8).

### Share Creative Ideas

In [last month's newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/letters/new-job-opportunities-community-call-plans-chapters-and-other-updates), we invited contributions to several open issues on *The Turing Way* repository, several of which are still looking for creative solutions.
Help us create an [image gallery](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2046) in Jupyter Book, document short [guidance on Alt Text](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2043), share your [user experience and wishes](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2034) and help us [update the translated versions of the README page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/2051).

### JupyterHub Community and *The Turing Way* Collaboration

Chris Holdgraf received Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) for Science funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) to establish a JupyterHub Community Lead Strategic position, which will be taken by Sarah Gibson.
The team will partner with *The Turing Way* to help build a community strategy to provide onboarding and mentorship for historically underrepresented groups in the JupyterHub community.
Congratulations to Chris, Sarah and the entire JupyterHub community.
You can read more about the project on the [CZI EOSS page](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/).
