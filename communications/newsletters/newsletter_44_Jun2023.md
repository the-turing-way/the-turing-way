## Community News and Updates

### Turing Way Book Dash: 13-17 November 2023

Can you believe that it's already time to start thinking about our next Book Dash!?

**Please save the date (13-17 November 2023) and apply to join the Planning Committee.**

If you have participated in a Book Dash before we would love to invite you to join the Book Dash Planning Committee. [You can apply to join the committee here](https://forms.gle/MpWwbNqrarb1VouN9).

We received some excellent feedback from our previous committee members and we are keen to fold their expertise into the next iteration of the Book Dash. 
We are likely to invest time in updating the [guidance in the Community Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) for both the Planning Committee and the Book Dash event itself over the next few months. 
This is a great time to join the core staff team in capturing best practices for delivering an exciting, collaborative, inclusive hybrid event.

**The deadline to apply to join the Book Dash Planning Committee is 21 July 2023, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.**

### Host a Local Hub to Engage your Local Community

We have also opened applications for Book Dash Local Hubs. Our London Hub and the TU Delft Hubs ([read this blog about their work here!](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2023/05/31/the-turing-way-book-dash-at-tu-delft/)) fostered wonderful collaborations and connections in May 2023. 
We are very keen to have more hubs join the event!

You can [apply to host a Book Dash Local Hub here](https://forms.gle/g1vzibjNz5gkFT7D8). 
Please submit your application as soon as possible, even if you don't have all your local details finalised. We are keen to help!

Please get in touch if you have any questions or feedback by email at turingway@turing.ac.uk or in our [#askaway](https://theturingway.slack.com/archives/C01ESKR7WN4) channel on Slack.

### Rewatch our latest *The Turing Way* Fireside Chat (29 June 2023)

On Thursday 29 June, we hosted a new Fireside Chat on **"Between computation, climate and culture: perspectives on sustainability and research"**.

Facilitated by **[Alejandro Coca-Castro](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/alejandro-coca-castro)** of the Environmental Data Science book and **[Carlos Martinez-Ortiz](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/team/dr-carlos-martinez-ortiz/)** of the Netherlands eScience Center (both core contributors to *The Turing Way*), this panel featured reflections from **[Claire Buckley](https://juliesbicycle.com/about-us/people/claire-buckley/)** (Julie's Bicycle), **[Loïc Lannelongue](https://www.lannelongue.eu/)** (Green Algorithms, University of Cambridge), **[Shannon Dosemagen](https://www.shannondosemagen.com/)** (Open Environmental Data Project), and **[Anne Pasek](https://www.annepasek.com/)** (Low Carbon Research Methods).

Together, these panelists unpacked the shared landscape of projects related to computation, culture, and climate – sharing questions, challenges, and ways to develop shared understanding between them.

**Watch the [recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrkFFswPGOE) and share it with your network!**

### Welcoming our Experts in Residence in *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub

This year we are piloting ***The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub** as an extension of *The Turing Way* to collaborate with organisations in their efforts for embedding best practices in their work.

Our inaugural cohort is joined by five Experts in Residence (EiR) representing their organisations and bringing perspectives from their respective sectors. 

**Please join us in welcoming them into *The Turing Way* community**:

- [Lucy Stephenson](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/lustep/) from [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/)
- [Wenjia Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjia-tang-20880414/?originalSubdomain=uk) from [Digihaul](https://www.digihaul.com/)
- [Stephen Haben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-haben-062bb148/?originalSubdomain=uk) from [Energy Systems Catapult](https://es.catapult.org.uk/)
- [Raphael Sonabend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-sonabend/?originalSubdomain=uk) from [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
- [Rowan Hemsi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-hemsi-3a7396136/?originalSubdomain=uk) from [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)

For the next six months, between June and December 2023, we will be working with them in exploring the state of best practices for data science in their respective fields.
Each EiR will be engaging across a range of activities in the Practitioners Hub including expert-led cohort calls, case study curation from their respective organisations and peer-mentoring activities.
We will be planning community events with them to share updates from this initiative.
