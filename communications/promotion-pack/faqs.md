# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I get involved in _The Turing Way_?
- There are multiple pathways to get involved.
The project is maintained and developed via a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).
You can help review the contributions added to the project through currently [open pull requests](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls).
You can start a discussion on a new topic by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose).
If you are new to GitHub, connect with the community via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) or [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack) and the core members will help you by pointing you to the right materials.
There are also community co-working calls every week and [Online Collaboration Cafes](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html) every month where you can work with the core members in real-time.

## Is there an onboarding process?
- There is a community [contribution guideline](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that is required for new contributors to get familiar with.
With the details provided there, you would be able to identify the best available options for you to get involved in the project.
In any case, the community members can be contacted via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) or [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack), or the core team can be reached out to by [email](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com).

## How much time commitment is needed by its community members?
- Anyone can contribute to the project as per their availability.
Many of our contributors regularly collaborate with the project as reviewers and maintainers, by helping other members to contribute to the project.
Some members also engage with the project as readers and users, occasionally raising errors such as typos and bugs and fixing them.
Most chapters are developed by different groups of contributors who collaboratively design, write, edit, and review their content.
This collaborative way of working allows several members to share responsibility without burdening one person so that they can engage in their own schedule.

## Why the content of _The Turing Way_ does not belong to one person or one group, but to the community?
- In Kirstie Whitaker's words (the lead of this project)
> There are three answers to this question. One is that openness is a political act of justice and empowerment. 
> Disseminating knowledge is not a capitalistic activity: I am not lessened by sharing information whose generation and synthesis was funded by the UK taxpayer. 
> The second is that I believe in the power and creativity of diverse groups. 
> A community-created resource will be better and more effective than one developed by "me" or "my team". 
> Finally, writing the book together under an open source license supports its scalability. 
> The Turing Way can only achieve its hugely ambitious goals of making reproducible research "too easy not to do" if we all work together to use, re-use, remix and refine the content for specific use cases across all aspects of data-intensive research."
