# Resources for representing The Turing Way at external events


## What is The Turing Way?
- A book: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/)
- An open source project: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)
- A community: *The Turing Way is an Open Source collaborative project that involves and supports its members of diverse skills and backgrounds to ensure that data science is accessible and useful for everyone.
Its moonshot goal is to make reproducible research 'too easy not to do'.*

## Who are the community members? 
- Project co-leads: 
  - Dr. Kirstie Whitaker, Director of the [Tools, Practices, and Systems (TPS) Research Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems), The Alan Turing Institute
  - Dr. Malvika Sharan, Senior Researcher - Open Research, TPS, The Alan Turing Institute
- Community Manager: Anne Lee-Steele, The Alan Turing Institute
- Members of [*The Turing Way* core team](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) are:
  - the members of the [Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research), Research Application Management and Project Management teams of the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme. 
  - in-kind contributors and community volunteers who engage with the project in a sustained manner, often leading on important tasks related to the project. 
- All contributors of *The Turing Way* collaborate on GitHub to develop The Turing Way materials online and participate in the project in different capacities. You can learn about them in our [Record of Contributions](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html).
- Users: Hundreds of readers/users across the globe (average 3000 unique visitors monthly - as noted in April 2021).

## Slide decks:

All the slide decks (1 slide, lightning talk, and short talks) are currently being developed in a [shared GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mzGmbJkPnP5q1goQesxDc_E5zAPL0eTF?usp=sharing).
Upon approval, they will be added to the GitHub repository and a Zenodo link will be created for easy citation.
All the previous talks by the team members have been uploaded on Zenodo community page of _The Turing Way_: [https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way/](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way/).
