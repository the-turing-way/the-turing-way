## Title
The Turing Way: A how-to guide to data science

## Project description 
The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led and collaboratively developed “book project” on making data research accessible for a wider research community (https://book.the-turing-way.org). 
We bring together individuals from diverse fields and expertise to develop practices and learning resources that can make data research accessible and easy to understand. 
Our community members are researchers, engineers, data librarians, industry professionals, and experts in various domains, at all levels of seniority, from all around the world. 
They collaborate in the project to develop chapters by compiling best practices, tools and recommendations used by the researchers and data science communities worldwide.

### Technical details
All questions, comments, recommendations and discussions are facilitated through an online GitHub repository (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). 
The online book with multiple guides is hosted as a Jupyter Book (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/) at https://book.the-turing-way.org. 
Jupyter Book formats markdown files and Jupyter notebooks as static HTML making them easy to read. When a notebook is included in the book, the static page includes a link to an interactive version of the notebook via Binder (https://mybinder.readthedocs.io). 
Additional styling of the front end is possible by providing a CSS file that handles it across the entire book.

### GSoC project plan
Since the project's launch in 2019, about 250 contributors have so far co-authored more than 140 subchapters and community documents on reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design and ethics. 
As the number of chapters continues to increase, it is important for us to offer appropriate ways for our readers to discover relevant and desired content in the book based on their topics of interest and skill levels. 
A GSoC contributor will help us in developing such a feature in the project that provides an enhanced filtering or search functionality in the book. 
Based on their interest and availability, they will have the possibility to contribute to the development of Python scripts and GitHub actions to enhance the project workflow, chapter development, community engagement and the overall interactivity in the book. 
They will be provided with appropriate guidance and the opportunity to work in a positive working environment. 
They will be fairly acknowledged for their contributions to the project.

### Expected outcome
1. An enhanced version of The Turing Way’s online book by providing an advanced filtering or search feature that will allow our readers to navigate through the book and find the information they are looking for. 
2. Upstream contribution of newly developed features to the Jupyter Book project will be a plus and supported by the mentors.

### Required skills
1. Python programming skills (intermediate to advanced)
2. Basic web-development skill required to work with Jupyter Book
3. Experience working in distributed communities, using git and GitHub

### Optional skills
- Interactive visualisation of small datasets
- Experience collaborating on data science or quantitative research projects at any level
- JavaScript skills (for front end development)

### Possible mentors
- Lead mentor: Malvika Sharan (msharan@turing.ac.uk) 
- Co-mentors: Batool Almarzouq and Martina Vilas

*No planned longer absences during the lead up/student interaction period (February 1 - April 19, especially the last week) or the project period (May 17 - August 30), however, it is possible based on the pandemic situation. **We have proposed two co-mentors so that at least one of us can be present to support the GSoC mentee at all time.***
