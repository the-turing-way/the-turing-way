**The upcoming Fireside chat is on Date - Month - Year**

Register here to attend: [add registration page link].

## Before the Event -- at least 6-8 weeks in advance

- [ ] Create a planning issue on GitHub using the [issue template - Fireside Chat Checklist](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/new/choose)
- [ ] A Turing Way team member (Community Manager or Research Project Manager) will create a Zoom link with a waiting room and live transcription enabled. They will also open the call on the day of the event, and give 'co-host rights' to all facilitators to allow them to manage Zoom participants and chats.
- [ ] Identify an overarching theme that we share with a different community -- Fireside Chat is intended to promote cross-community collaboration
- [ ] Reach out to a community representative who can co-facilitate the event with a core team member in The Turing Way
- [ ] Set up an internal shared document for discussions and notes (The Turing Way shared google doc, see [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_NfRkkH6p47yRgpd6xlw8yrvo6jIsbF_mV0BinjcaQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- [ ] Discuss what the co-hosts might want to highlight at this Fireside Chat (note: these discussions don't necessarily need to identify a solution - [ ] but should recognise shared themes, challenges, and spaces for research communities
- [ ] Identify speakers from the community and invite them
- [ ] Create a private Slack Channels with all speakers and hosts and discuss some overarching topics they are interested in sharing
- [ ] Ask for the bio and image of speakers, and their permission to record the session
- [ ] Schedule the first check-in 4-5 weeks in advance to surface some common themes, helping plan the title and questions
- [ ] Decide on a common date and send placeholder calendar invite blocking their calendar for the event (15 mins pre-event tech-check/Green room, 60 minutes live and 15-30 minutes unrecorded discussion with the audience)
- [ ] Create an Eventbrite page in The Turing Way account - see [this page for example](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/navigating-growth-and-scale-to-sustain-open-communities-tickets-360328802147) (you can copy and edit)
- [ ] Set up the Etherpad using the template provided here: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/fireside-chats (see [this example](https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-fireside-chat-mar2022))
- [ ] Create a paragraph to add to the Eventbrite page along with the speakers' and hosts' bio
- [ ] Create a flyer to share on social media using [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fx2WcVvGX6dM3z74VDQp_UD8edKp6Phl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102682705838770934280&rtpof=true&sd=true)

- [ ] Announce at least 3-4 weeks in advance on Slack, Newsletter, Twitter and different talks
- [ ] Add information to the Intro hackmd: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/demo-intro
- [ ] Hosts will define an agenda and questions for the session - hosts will also allocate some questions for each other to speak on
- [ ] Set another check-in at least 2 weeks in advance to touch base and discuss the plans and questions with the speakers - assign 1-2 questions for each speaker to begin
- [ ] Plan with cohost who will ask which question, how you will time keep, what channel you will use to ask questions to each other privately, who will monitor the chat (maybe ask someone outside this group to help with note taking and chat monitoring)
- [ ] Update the calendar invite with Zoom, Etherpad and Eventbrite -- encouraging them to share the Eventbrite page in their network
- [ ] Identify someone from the community who can do the introduction of The Turing Way, code of conduct reminder and pass it to the speakers
