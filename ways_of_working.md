# Ways of Working

The "Ways of Working" document provides an overview of how members of *The Turing Way* community collaborate across the [three levels of governance](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/governance).

For information about the members involved in the governance, including the Project Delivery Team, please refer to the documentation on [governance roles](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/GOVERNANCE_ROLES.md).

This document offers high-level information on communication, community structures, and project management processes.
For details, please refer to the Foreword, Afterword, and Community Handbook within *The Turing Way* book: [book.the-turing-way.org/](https://book.the-turing-way.org/).

## Participation in _The Turing Way_

All contributors are invited to participate in the Community Level Governance.
Please follow our [Contributing Guideline](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We maintain a [Contributors Table](./README.md#contributors), [Record of Contributions](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record.html), and apply [_The Turing Way_ acknowledgement process](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement/acknowledgement-members.html#community-members-contributors-and-co-authors) to recognise and credit all kinds of contributions in _The Turing Way_.

### Commitments Towards Our Community

All members, especially at the maintenance and constitution levels, commit to:
- following the contribution guidelines and keeping them up to date
- abiding by and supporting the enforcement of the Code of Conduct in all community platforms and spaces where they represent _The Turing Way_.
- offering their time and expertise to fixing open issues either directly via GitHub or providing mentorship and support to community members and project contributors.
- making the implicit knowledge explicit by documenting their work and helping define our processes.
- recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration.
- feedback on issues in open source software used throughout _The Turing Way_ by opening an issue _The Turing Way_ GitHub repo or other open source projects where this issue can be fixed.
- documenting and sharing any (non-sensitive/non-confidential) conversation from closed spaces (such as email, Slack, or 1:1 meeting) in a GitHub issue that could be useful for the community or community members in enabling their work in _The Turing Way_.

## Communication

Below we have listed all communication channels used in _The Turing Way_.
For details, please refer to the [Communication Platforms](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/communication-channels) chapters in the Community Handbook.

You can reach out to all members listed in our [governance document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) by tagging them on GitHub issues or Pull Requests, or directly on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-2v7euwuo7-BYstHdKuTNd1ce0puDtBxA).

Please join the fortnightly [Collaboration Cafes](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html), which are great places to discuss ideas for new contributions and to get started with making them.

Talks, presentations and recordings from different events are posted on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA) regularly.

### Regular Community Events

Hosted all throughout the year, our recurring community calls are important and engaging spaces where you can participate in _The Turing Way_!

Some require signing up (📝) and some don't (✅).
All members are welcome to join these calls! ✨

- ✅ **Collaboration Café**: These are online coworking spaces for everyone, hosted fortnightly from 15:00 to 17:00 UK time. Here you can meet others from the community, do some focused co-writing, or catch up with the Working Groups ([Collaboration Café Chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe)).
- 📝 **Community forums**: These calls are hosted every two months by the project delivery team to share governance-related updates with the community.
- 📝 **Onboarding calls**: These calls are hosted by the community management Working Groups to onboard new members of the community in the project ([Onboarding and Offboarding Chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/onboarding-offboarding)).
- 📝 **Fireside Chats**: _The Turing Way_ members collaborate with different communities to co-design and co-host Fireside Chat events that are informal yet structured discussions on topics of shared interests across research/data science communities ([Fireside Chat Chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/fireside-chat)).

## Events and Meetings

Details of regular and special events are recorded in the [community calendar](https://calendar.the-turing-way.org).

## GitHub management

All members help triage open issues, review Pull Requests or address any questions raised on GitHub asynchronously.
As none of the members work full-time on _The Turing Way_, it will always take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed. Don't be afraid to nudge if they've not replied after a few days! :sparkling_heart:

### Issues & Pull Requests

All members, especially at the maintenance and constitution levels, will:
- monitor open issues and Pull Requests on the project's GitHub repository to identify if feedback, comments or connections can help address any concern or build on any suggested ideas/features.
- Whenever possible, post about the issues and Pull Requests in public forums (newsletter, Slack, Twitter) to facilitate participation from new members in the community.
- Review or assign a reviewer to open Pull Requests for review. This should be taken as an opportunity to connect contributors with specific interests, availability or technical skills that could be useful for the ongoing work.
- connect issues and Pull Requests where possible (for example, by mentioning 'Fixes #[issue number]' in the Pull Request description). By adding "closes #issue" or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- once completed, approve Pull Requests (for the contributors to merge them) and/or close issues immediately (if not linked to a specific Pull Request) with a comment describing how it was addressed.
- When reviewing a pull request or commenting on issues, be specific, describe your ideas clearly, share a comment to request changes or make a pull request to the file that should be merged (please do not use the "request changes" option when reviewing Pull Requests).
- Use your interactions on GitHub or other community spaces to provide support, mentorship and acknowledgement to our community of contributors.

## Authorship and Contributorship in _The Turing Way_

Anyone who contributes to the book is considered an author of _The Turing Way_.

Our Community Handbook provides detailed processes and guidelines for 
[Acknowledging Contributors](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/acknowledgement). 
This section offers an overview and highlights the main points to ensure you have an initial understanding.

**The first author is always `The Turing Way Community`.**

You don't have to have written a chapter to be listed as an author.
Substantial contributions to the running of the project, for example, creating or improving documentation, supporting a group to contribute to *The Turing Way*, hosting an event, giving a talk or onboarding new members to *The Turing Way*, all count as core contributions warranting authorship.

Contributing small amounts over a long time, and improving the project strategy also counts for authorship.

*The Turing Way* repository is archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) at doi: [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853).

Each release has its own **doi**, and there is a **concept doi** (listed above) which always renders to the latest release.

For example `v0.0.1` is available at [10.5281/zenodo.3233854](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233854), `v0.0.2` is available at [10.5281/zenodo.3233892](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233892) and so on.

We release a new version every 6 months or if substantial updates to existing chapters are made, such as after Book Dash events.

Authorship is cumulative.
If you have been added as an author on one release, you will stay as an author on all future releases.

***Thank you for contributing to the Turing Way!*** We value your thoughtful participation and contributions to _The Turing Way_!
