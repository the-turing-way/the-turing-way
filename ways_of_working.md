## Commitments

All The Turing Way project members commit to
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work
- abiding by the Code of Conduct in all community platforms and spaces where they represent _The Turing Way_
- following the contribution guideline and keeping it up to date
- recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- dedicating their time and expertise in fixing open issues either directly via GitHub or providing mentorship and support to community members and project contributors
- feedback on issues in open source software used throughout _The Turing Way_ by opening an issue _The Turing Way_ GitHub repo or other open source projects where this issue can be fixed
- documenting and sharing any conversation from closed spaces (such as email, Slack or 1:1 meeting) in a GitHub issue that could be useful for the community or community members in enabling their work in _The Turing Way_

## Communication

You can reach out to all members by tagging them on GitHub issues or Pull Requests or on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw).

You can reach the lead investigators of the project through their preferred way of communication:
You can mention Malvika Sharan (@malvikasharan) and Kirstie Whitaker (@KirstieJane) on a Github issue or pull request, or tag in Slack.
In addition, you can reach _The Turing Way_ by email (managed by the community manager): theturingway@gmail.com.
You can also contact Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

Please join the project members and the wider Turing Way community at our twice-monthly [Collaboration Cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html), which are great places to discuss ideas for new contributions and to get started with making them. :rocket:

Talks, presentations and recordings from different events are posted on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA) regularly.

## Project management

The project members triage on open issues, review Pull Requests or address any questions raised on GitHub asynchronously.
As most members do not work full time on the _Turing Way_, it might take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed. Don't be afraid to nudge if they've not replied after a few days! :sparkling_heart:

### Issues & Pull Requests

Project members will:
- monitor open issues and Pull Requests on the project's GitHub repository to identify if feedback, comment or connections can help address any concern or build on any suggested ideas/features.
- whenever possible, post about the issues and Pull Requests in public forums (newsletter, Slack, Twitter) to facilitate participation from new members in the community.
- review or assign a reviewer to open Pull Requests for review. This should be taken as an opportunity to connect contributors with specific interests, availability or technical skills that could be useful for the ongoing work.
- connect issues and Pull Requests where possible (for example, by mentioning 'Fixes #[issue number]' in the Pull Request description). By adding "closes #issue" or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- once completed, approve Pull Requests (for the contributors to merge them) and/or close issues immediately (if not linked to specific Pull Request) with a comment describing how it was addressed.
- when reviewing a pull request or commenting on issues, be specific, describe your ideas clearly, comment to request changes or make a pull request to the file that should be merged (please do not use the "request changes" option when reviewing Pull Requests).
- use your interactions on GitHub or other community spaces to provide support, mentorship and acknowledgement to our community of contributors.
