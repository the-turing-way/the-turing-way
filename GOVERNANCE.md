### Recognising contributors

*The Turing Way* uses the [emoji-key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) to recognise everyone who contributes to the Turing Way project.

Our barrier for entry to the [list of contributors](README#contributors) is very low.
If you have contributed in any of the ways above then please ask one of the core team to use the [all contributors bot :robot:](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/overview) to add you to the list.

***Thank you for contributing!*** :sparkling_heart::raised_hands::tada:

### Authorship on the Turing Way

*Note that we have not (yet) archived the Turing Way repositories on Zenodo.*
*We hope to soon!*

*The Turing Way* is archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way).

Each release has its own **doi**, and there is a **concept doi** which always renders to the latest release.

We release a new version when a new chapter is merged into *The Turing Way*.
Anyone who substantially contributed to the chapter is added to the list of authors.

Additionally, new authors may be added if they have substantially contributed to the running of the project.
For example, adding in (or improving) documentation on *how* someone can contribute to the Turing Way, why they would, or how they can test the jupyter book, all count as core contributions warrenting authorship.

Contributing small amounts over a long time, and thinking about the strategy for the project also count for authorship.

"Substantial" is a subjective term.
As the project is quite small at the moment, the lead investigator Dr Kirstie Whitaker, will decide whether a contribution or collection of contributions is *substantial* enough to be given authorship.
She can be contacted by email at kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk.

Authorship is cumulative.
If you have been added as an author on one release, you will stay as an author on all future releases.

Authors are listed in alphabetical order by last name.
The first author is always "The Turing Way".

***Thank you for contributing substantially to the Turing Way!*** We could not do this without you! :hibiscus::sunflower::rocket::star2:
