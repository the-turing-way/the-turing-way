# Open Life Science mentoring and Training

[Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/) is a 16-week mentoring and training program for early-stage researchers and potential academic leaders to become ambassadors for open research in their communities.

## The Turing Way collaborates with OLS: *OLS-2 for Turing*

**Mentoring period: September to December 2020**

To specifically support members at The Alan Turing Institute, OLS has collaborated with _The Turing Way_ to offer “OLS-2 for Turing” training and mentoring for projects run by individuals or teams to help members integrate open research practices in their workflow.
See details here: [https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators)

## OLS-2 for Turing projects

Congratulations to the following 6 projects that will join the second cohort (OLS-2) under the collaboration *OLS-2 for Turing*.
See [this post for the announcement](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/09/01/ols2-announcement/) along with the [details of 31 projects](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/) that will be trained and mentored in OLS-2.

## OLS-2 for Turing graduation

We are delighted to announce that 12 project leads, who had joined the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) training and mentoring program under the [OLS-2 for Turing](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators) collaboration, are successfully graduating from their second cohort next week.
Three graduation calls will take place on 15, 16 and 17 December 2020, information for which is available on this HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/@ols-2/week-16](https://hackmd.io/@ols-2/week-16).
