## Welcome

We are developing the Ethical Research Chapter of The Turing Way, and are super excited to have you here!

## Vision and Goal

Our Vision is to create a framework that supports an ethical research mindset and its practical application within a researcher-driven data science community.
The goal is to build a community (that's you!) that feels volitionally empowered to feed forward into the further development of these ethical science practices in a virtuous cycle.

As this chapter fits in to The Turing Way, our goal is to create a community that feels volitionally empowered to
- use the principles and practices within the book in their own work,
- advocate for the use of these principles and practices in their research communities,
- contribute back their learnings to the chapter,
- and grow towards leadership the further development of our ethical research community.

## The Project

We have identified that:
- Not enough people know about TTW-Ethics, and are able to use it and advocate for it
- Even if people know about TTW-Ethics, they don’t feel able to join the community of practice around it - because they don’t think they have the skills, expertise, and/or they feel intimidated

So, we are:
- Creating a culture that is welcoming and inclusive for people who are interested in ethics and want to contribute to TTW-Ethics
- Using the tools that the broader TTW community is developing to lower the technical barrier for contributions
- Creating a framework for becoming part of the community, contributing, learning, teaching in a virtuous cycle of love
- Creating scaffolding and documentation to help people find a place where they can contribute and where they feel like they can 'fit in' to the broader community

We have some metrics that we will use to identify if we are doing this well:
- Number of (active) contributors
- Existence of documentation
- Viewers/participants in our community activities

We have identified that we need these resources:
- Time
- Skills: github, community management, organisational development, communications, leadership, project development
- Interest in/thoughts about ethical research
- Thoughtfulness (including critical thinking skills, reflectiveness, open-mindedness)

We are hoping that our community members - contributors and users - will be researchers, scientists and those who work with data, who want to talk about ethics in research and be part of a learning process - in their own work and as part of a community. Our early adopters will be people who already have strong views (inspiration), a will to contribute (frustration), and technical skills (perspiration).

We will be aiming to bring in contributors and users through:
- Being open and accessible throughout the development process of the framework - includng through communications channels such as existing TTW community channels, conferences, twitter, twitch, hackmd...)
- Taking advantage of (all kinds of) opportunities to speak about the project!
- Bringing in early adopters to these channels

We offer a way to address both technical and cultural barriers - in an inclusive way that brings people into a community that is continually building and learning together. We are a group that already includes diverse skills and backgrounds: neuroscience, human rights and philosophy - and we want to build a broad, inclusive and welcoming community!
