# To create a minimal change suggestion, prettier was introduced to auto-format
# the YAML files only. It is absolutely reasonable to auto-format markdown files
# and json files as well, but for now, let's make prettier only auto-format
# YAML.
# NOTE: .cff files are a type of YAML
#
**/*.md
**/*.json

# Other file types we should always ignore as they are likely auto-generated
#
**/*.css
**/*.js
