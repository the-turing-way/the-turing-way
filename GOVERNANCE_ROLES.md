# Governance Roles in _The Turing Way_

Governance in *_The Turing Way_* occurs across three Constitutional Levels as discussed in the [governance chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/governance).

This document provides details about the governance roles and members collaborating across all levels of governance in _The Turing Way_.

This document also lists the members of the project delivery team, who support community management, maintenance of _The Turing Way_ resources and delivery of the project goals.

For an overview of how members of *_The Turing Way_* community collaborate across these three levels of governance, please refer to the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) documentation.

## Participation and Engagement at the Community Level

At the Community Level, participation is comprised of the everyday actions and decisions made by all community members as they participate in the community and contribute to the book.
Expectations and responsibilities for all members, including Code of Conduct, Contributing Guidelines and Acknowledgements, have been provided and maintained in [_The Turing Way_ Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/community-handbook).

All contributors to _The Turing Way_ are listed as [Contributors in the README file](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) and invited to optionally share narrative details in the [contributors.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/contributors.md).

Information from these base files is also published as the [Contributors Record](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record) in the afterwards of the book.

Please refer to the Foreword of the book to learn about different kinds of [community roles](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/community).

## Maintenance Level Roles

At the Maintenance Level, different groups of people come together to work on and promote specific areas and initiatives in the project, as well as define or change processes to make Community Level participation easier.
Please read [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) for community structure, commitments and resources used by members at the Maintenance Level.

## Representation at Constitution Level Steering Committee

"Constitutional-level" participation in the Steering Committee by community leaders allows the development, approval and establishment of Working Group and project-related norms that affect the entire project, community and sustainability.

Please read [Ways of Working document](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) for community structure, commitments and resources used by members at the Maintenance Level, which also applies to the Constitution Level.
Specific governance documentation and processes for this level will be developed with the founding members of the Steering Committee in 2025.

Chairs or a designated representative of the following **Working Groups** join the Steering Committee at this level:

- **Community Management Working Group**
- **Infrastructure Working Group**
- **Book Dash Working Group**
- **Accessibility Working Group**
- **Translation and Localisation Working Group**

Leads or designated representatives of the **Delivery Groups** for the following projects within _The Turing Way_ also serve on the Steering Committee for accountability:

- **_The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub**, a Turing Way project under the Innovate UK BridgeAI initiative that engages with industries in sharing and adopting best practices for data science and AI.
- **JupyterHub -_The Turing Way_ Project**: A CZI-funded project in collaboration with Organizational Mycology to reinvigorate community practices within JupyterHub and share generalisable findings with the wide community via _The Turing Way_.
- **Data Science Without Borders** (DSWB), a Wellcome Trust-funded project that leverages _The Turing Way_ for adopting and sharing best practices with the DSWB community.
